## Rules
- Works like HTML, but we can enter "JavaScript mode" by using `{}` (for text or attributes)
- We can place JavaScript expressions inside `{}`
	- Examples include: reference variables, create arrays or objects, `[].map()`, ternary operators
- Statements are NOT allowed `if / else, for, switch`
- JSX produces a JavaScript expression
	- We can place other pieces of JSX inside `{}`
	- We can write JSX anywhere inside a component (in if / else, assign to variables, pass it into functions)

- A piece of JSX can only have one root element. If you need more, use `<React.Fragment>` (or the short <>)

## Differences from HTML
- `className` instead of HTML's class
- `htmlFor` instead of HTML's for
- Every tag needs to be closed 
	- `<img />` or `<br />`
- All event handlers and other properties need to be `camelCased` 
	- Examples: `onClick, onMouseOver`
- Exception: `aria-*` and `data-*` are written with dashes link in HTML
- CSS inline styles are written like this: `{{<style>}}` (to reference a variable, then an object)
- CSS property names are also `camelCased`
- Comments need to be in `{}` because they are JS

## Imperative vs Delcarative

- Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work
- Components must return a block of JSX
- Extension of JavaScript that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS and React Components into HTML

- Each JSX element is converted to a `React.createElement` function call automatically by `babel`
- We could use React without JSX, but ain't nobody got time for that

### Imperative
- Outlines *how we do things*
- Manual DOM element selects and DOM traversing
- Step by step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI

### Declarative
- Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
- React is an abstraction away from the DOM: we never touch it
- Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data
