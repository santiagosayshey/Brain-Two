## What is probability? 
- Number of outcomes favourable to the event divided by the total number of outcomes

### Numerically
- P(x) is the probability of an event x occurring in a given sample space
- If P(A) and P(B) are independent, then the probability of either event occurring is P(A) + P(B)
- *If they are not independent, then it gets more complicated*

## Conditional Probability
- The likelihood that an event A will occur, given that an event B has already occurred

- If A and B are independent, P(A|B) must just be P(A) as it's not affected by P(B)
