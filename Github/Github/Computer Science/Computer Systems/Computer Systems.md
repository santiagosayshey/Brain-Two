- Source code is human-readable and represents high-level instructions. To execute these instructions, a compiler is used to translate the source code into machine-readable low-level machine code.
- All general-purpose computers, from PCs to smartphones, are fundamentally 'Nand to Tetris' machines, built on elementary logic gates like Nand, and capable of running complex programs such as Tetris. The journey from basic switching devices to a full-featured computer system is a critical aspect of understanding computer systems

## Abstraction and Implementation
- In system engineering, the abstraction of a module refers to what it does, while the implementation refers to how it does it
- When using a module as a building block, the focus should be solely on its abstraction, not its implementation details
