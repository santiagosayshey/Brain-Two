- Going back to  `exhaustive search function`
#### Worst Case

- In other words, it grows `linearly`

#### Best Case

- In other words, its not growing and is a `constant of 1`

## Growing Rates

# Analysing Algorithm Peformance

- For Loops
	- O(n times computational complexity of the statements inside the loop))
	- Where n is the number of loops
- Nested Loops
	- O(n times m times computational complexity of the statements inside the loop)
	- Where n is number of outer loops
	- Where m is number of inner loops
- While Loops

- Sequence of Statements
	- Take the highest complexity

- If / Else statement
	- Take the max from each if / else
