- Make the locally optimal choice at each stage (with the hope) to find a global optimum
	- Greedy algorithms mostly fail to find the globally optimal solution, because they usually do note operate exhaustively on all the data
	- If a greedy algorithm can be proven to yield the global optimum for a given problem, it typically becomes the method of choice


##### Examples
- Giving change (with Australian currency)
- Huffman Encoding
- Finding minimum spanning trees (Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm)
