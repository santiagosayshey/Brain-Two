## Problem Statement

```
The inchworm is a creature of regular habits. She inches forward some distance along the branch of a tree, then stops to rest. If she has stopped at a leaf, she makes a meal of it. Then she inches forward the same distance as before, and repeats this routine until she has reached or passed the end of the branch.

Consider an inchworm traveling the length of a branch whose leaves are spaced at uniform intervals. Depending on the distance between her resting points, the inchworm may or may not be able to eat all of the leaves. There is always a leaf at the beginning of the branch, which is where the inchworm rests before setting out on her journey.

You are given three int values that specify, in inches: the length of the branch; the distance traveled by the inchworm between rests; and the distance between each consecutive pair of leaves. Given that the inchworm only eats at rest, calculate the number of leaves she will consume.

## Definition

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Class:|Inchworm|
|Method:|lunchtime|
|Parameters:|int, int, int|
|Returns:|int|
|Method signature:|int lunchtime(int branch, int rest, int leaf)|

## Notes

```
The inchworm starts by gobbling up the leaf at the beginning of the branch.
If there is a leaf at the end of the branch, the inchworm eats it only if it falls at a resting point.
```

## Constraints

-	*branch* is between 1 and 1000000 (one million), inclusive
-	*rest* is between 1 and 1000, inclusive
-	*leaf* is between 1 and 1000, inclusive

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts

Initially, I would think to use a for loop that iterates the length of the branch. An if statement should check if the current index is a factor of the leaf growth (which determines if a leaf exists at position n). An ordered map should be used to store true / false values of whether or not there is a leaf at any current position. 

We would then iterate over the branch again, iterating in lengths of the inchworms rest cycles. We would check if the current position is true in the map, and if so, a counter will be incremented by 1. This counter always starts at 1 since the inchworm will always eat a leaf at the beginning of her journey. 

This incremented value represents the number of leaves eaten and so we return this value. 

### Attempt 1
got the bones in of what I think will work eventually. I think there is an issue with checking the modulus of the current position to determine if there is a leaf there or not.

### Attempt 2
the issue was that I was checking if the modulus of the leaf positions was truthy, and not 0 which was placing a leaf at every wrong position. To fix this, I edited the if statement. Furthermore, I changed the loop to now start from 0 to make it a bit easier to understand.

### Reflection
Thinking back on my design, it would have been much easier and more space efficient to just use a single for loop that iterates every rest cycle and checks the modulus in each loop. While still having the same time complexity, this vastly reduces the space complexity and does not need to use a data structure to store anything at all. This solution would be vital in scenarios in which the branch is arbitrarily long.

## Solution

```cpp
int Inchworm::lunchtime(int branch, int rest, int leaf)
{
    std::unordered_map<int, bool> leafLocations;

    for (int i=0; i<branch+1; i++) {
        if (i % leaf == 0) {
            leafLocations[i]=true;
        }
        else {
            leafLocations[i]=false;
        }
    }

    int eaten = 0;

    for (int i=0; i<branch+1; i = i+rest) {
        if (leafLocations[i]) {
            eaten++;
        }
    }

    return eaten;
}
```
