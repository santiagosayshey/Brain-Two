## Problem Statement

```
You are given a String[] *data* representing a rectangular grid where each cell contains a digit. Find the largest square in this grid that contains the same digit in all of its corner cells. The sides of the square must be parallel to the sides of the grid. If there is more than one such largest square, pick any one of them.

Return the number of cells in the square. Note that a single cell is also considered a square, so there will always be an answer.
```
## Definition

```
Class:	SquareOfDigits
Method:	getMax
Parameters:	String[ ]
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int getMax(String[] data)
(be sure your method is public)
```

## Constraints

-	*data* will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-	Each element of *data* will contain between 1 and 50 digits ('0'-'9'), inclusive.
-	All elements of *data* will have the same length.
##### Examples

```
{"12",
 "34"}

Returns: 1

All digits in the grid are different, so the biggest feasible square has
only one cell.
```

```
{"1255",
 "3455"}

Returns: 4

Four '5' digits form a feasible square.
```

```
{"42101",
 "22100",
 "22101"}

Returns: 9

The largest square here is the 3 x 3 square that contains the digit '1'
in each of its corner cells.
```

```
{"1234567890"}

Returns: 1
```

```
{"9785409507",
 "2055103694",
 "0861396761",
 "3073207669",
 "1233049493",
 "2300248968",
 "9769239548",
 "7984130001",
 "1670020095",
 "8894239889",
 "4053971072"}

Returns: 49
```

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
- My first thoughts are that we need to check for squares of different sizes in the grid, where the largest possible square is determined by the smallest dimension of the grid. We should iterate from largest to smallest in this case, to improve efficiency. 
- For each possible square size, starting from the largest, iterate through the grid and check if there's a square of that size where all four corners contain the same digit.
	- If no such square can be found, return 1 since there will always be a square of that size
	- If there is, return the current size squared


### First Attempt

```cpp
#ifndef SQUAREOFDIGITS_H
#define SQUAREOFDIGITS_H

#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>

class SquareOfDigits
{
public:
    SquareOfDigits() {}
    ~SquareOfDigits() {}

    int getMax(std::vector<std::string> data)
    {
        int numRows = data.size();
        int numCols = data[0].size();

        int minDim = std::min(numRows, numCols);

        for (int size = minDim; size>0; size--) {
            for (int row=0; row<=numRows - size; row++) {
                for (int col=0; col<=numCols - size; col++) {
                    if (data[row].at(col) == data[row + size -1].at(col) &&
                        data[row].at(col) == data[row].at(col + size -1) &&
                        data[row].at(col) == data[row + size -1].at(col + size -1)
                    ) {
                        return size*size;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }

private:

};

#endif
```

- Got it working mostly first attempt, only troubleshooting I had to do was adjusting the loops to iterate starting from 0, instead 1+size

### Reflection
- Pretty happy with solution. This was another problem that was quite difficult to get from my head into code, but planning this one out thoroughly before coding helped tremendously.
- The abstraction of C++ libraries made me forget that strings are just character arrays, and a vector of strings is just a m by n array of characters. Realising this during planning made the problem way easier
- I don't believe the complexity of this problem can be improved beyond O(n^3)
- Best case is highly dependant on shape of initial array. We can have constant time if the array only has 1 string, since it's impossible to have a square bigger than 1
