## Problem Statement


```
There's a circular light rail line that contains n stations numbered 0 through n-1. The time to travel between stations 0 and 1 is *t*[0], the time to travel between stations 1 and 2 is *t*[1], ..., the time to travel between stations n-1 and 0 is *t*[n-1]. 

You can travel between stations in either direction, so there are always two ways to get from one station to another without visiting the same station more than once.

For example, if there are 4 stations, the two ways of getting from station 1 to station 3 are 1-2-3 and 1-0-3. The total travel time in the first case is *t*[1] + *t*[2], and in the second case, it is *t*[0] + *t*[3]. 

When a person needs to get from one station to another, she always chooses the faster of the two ways.

You are given a int[] *t*. Find two stations such that the fastest travel time between them is the maximal possible. Return this time.

## Definition

```
Class:	CircularLine
Method:	longestTravel
Parameters:	int[]
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int longestTravel(int[] t)
(be sure your method is public)
```

## Constraints

-	*t* will contain between 3 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-	Each element of *t* will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
 
##### Examples

```
{1,1,1,1}

Returns: 2
```

```
{1,4,4,1,5}

Returns: 7

The longest travel time is between stations 1 and 3.
```

```
{1,1,1000}

Returns: 2

You must never travel from station 2 to station 0 using the 1000 segment.
```

```
{1,1000,1,1000}

Returns: 1001
```

```
{1,1,1,1,4}

Returns: 4
```

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
- My immediate thought was thinking how bubble sort works. Cross checking each element inside a vector to every other element inside the vector. I think this might be able to work with checking distances between stops if we iterate both backwards and forwards to update a variable which holds the longest travel time. 
- We might not need to iterate backwards however, as we only want to check longest - I'm not sure there is a scenario in which longest time is mutually exclusive to either forwards or backwards travel.
