## Problem Statement

```
You are looking for a place to park your car on a suburban street. You can park at any position that meets the following requirements:

1.	It is not directly in front of a private driveway.
2.	It is not directly in front of a bus stop.
3.	It is not 5 meters before a bus stop.
4.	It is not 10 meters before a bus stop.
5.	It is not directly in front of a side-street.
6.	It is not 5 meters before a side-street.
7.	It is not 5 meters after a side-street.

The *street* will be represented as a String, where each character describes a section of the street 5 meters in length. 

So the first character describes the first 5 meters of the street, the second character describes the next 5 meters and so on. *street* will use 'D' for driveway, 'B' for bus stop, 'S' for side-street and '-' for all other sections of the street. 

A position is directly in front of an object if it has the same index as the object in *street*. A position is before an object if its index is lower than the index of the object in *street*. Finally, a position is after an object if its index is higher than the index of the object in *street*.

Given the *street* return the total number of possible parking spaces on that street.

## Definition

```
Class:	StreetParking
Method:	freeParks
Parameters:	String
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int freeParks(String street)
(be sure your method is public)
```

## Constraints

-	*street* will have between 1 and 50 characters inclusive.
-	*street* will only contain characters 'D', 'B', 'S' and '-'.
 
##### Examples

```
"---B--S-D--S--"

Returns: 4

The street looks like this:

---B--S-D--S--
^   ^    ^   ^
|   |    |   |

The arrows indicate where you are allowed to park on this street. Thus
the method should return 4.
```

```
"DDBDDBDDBDD"

Returns: 0

This street is full of private driveways and bus stops. You cannot park
anywhere on this street. The method should return 0.
```

```
"--S--S--S--S--"

Returns: 2

You can only park at the first and last positions on this street. The
method should return 2.
```


```
"SSD-B---BD-DDSB-----S-S--------S-B----BSB-S--B-S-D"
"00000100001000011110000011111100001100000000000000"
"00000100001000011110000111111100001100000000000010"

Returns: 14
```

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
- My initial thought is to break down what exactly a string is
	- It's an array of characters. 
- So this means we should get the total size of the array - this will give us the total number of 'items' in the street
- Then we iterate through the array, and tally the number bus stops, streets in the array
- For each negative item, we take 1 away from the total number of items, as well as any other constraints 

### First Attempt

```cpp
int StreetParking::freeParks(std::string street)
{
    int D=0;
    int B=0;
    int S=0;
    int spots=0;
    for (int i=0; i<street.size(); i++) {
        if (street[i] == 'B') {
            B++;
        } else if (street[i] == 'D') {
            D++;
        } else if (street[i] == 'S') {
            S++;
        }
        spots++;
    }
    B *= 3;
    S *= 3;
    spots -= D+B+S;
    
    return spots;
}
```

- First attempt works for cases where streets and stops aren't placed directly together. This needs to be fixed. 
- Need to change way spots are incremented, will try doing it directly within the for loop now. 

### Second Attempt

```cpp
int StreetParking::freeParks(std::string street)
{
    int spots=0;
    for (int i=0; i<street.size(); i++) {
        spots++;
        cout << spots << endl;
        if (street[i] == 'B') {
            spots--;
            cout <<  "removing bus stop" << endl;
            cout << spots << endl;
            if (i > 0 && street[i-1] == '-') {
                spots--;
                cout <<  "removing 5 metres before bus stop" << endl;
                cout << spots << endl;
            }
            if (i > 1 && street[i-2] == '-') {
                spots--;
                cout <<  "removing 10 metres before bus stop" << endl;
                cout << spots << endl;
            }
        } 
        if (street[i] == 'D') {
            spots--;
            cout <<  "removing driveway" << endl;
            cout << spots << endl;
        } 
        if (street[i] == 'S') {
            spots--;
            cout <<  "removing side street" << endl;
            cout << spots << endl;
            if (i > 0 && street[i-1] == '-') {
                cout <<  "removing 5 metres before side street" << endl;
                spots--;
                cout << spots << endl;
            }
            if (i < street.size()-1 && street[i+1] == '-') {
                spots--;
                cout <<  "removing 5 metres after side street" << endl;
                cout << spots << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    return spots;
}
```

- Fixed the edge cases, but still doesn't seem to work. I think the issue might be that were removing invalid parking spots more than once - say if there is a "S-S", we remove the middle spot twice when it should have been removed once
- To fix this, we should store key value pairs of indexes and bools to determine if a spot is valid or not. If it is, then we increment a counter

### Third Attempt

```cpp
int StreetParking::freeParks(std::string street)
{
    unordered_map<int, bool> spots;
    for (int i=0; i<street.size(); i++) {
        if (street[i] == 'D' || street[i] == 'B' || street[i] == 'S') {
            spots[i]=false;
        } else {
            spots[i]=true;
        }

        if (i < street.size()-1 && street[i+1] == 'B') {
            spots[i]=false;
        }
        if (i < street.size()-2 && street[i+2] == 'B') {
            spots[i]=false;
        }
        if (i < street.size()-1 && street[i+1] == 'S') {
            spots[i]=false;
        }
        if (i > 0 && street[i-1] == 'S') {
            spots[i]=false;
        }

    }
    int parkingSpots = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<street.size(); i++) {
        if (spots[i]) {
            parkingSpots++;
        }
    }

    return parkingSpots;
}
```

 - After much trial and error, I've finally got it working. Instead of proactively incrementing valid spots, im now just storing key value pairs of validity inside an index. 
 - This then allows another for loop to go through and increment the valid parking spots separately

### Reflection
- I found this problem quite difficult - trying multiple ways of doing the same thing. It would have been helpful to try and do it the most computationally expensive way first, as I had been doing with prior problems, and then work my way down to more efficient solutions 
- I can't think of a more efficient way to do this problem as It would be difficult to do it without storing information about parking spots first.
