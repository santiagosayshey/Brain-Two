## Problem Statement

```
There are *N* friends sitting in a circle, numbered clockwise in increasing order from 1 to *N*. At the beginning of the game, player 1 receives a ball. The players take turns passing the ball to each other.

At the beginning of the game and before each next pass the following actions are performed. If the player with the ball has already received the ball *M* times, the game is over. 

Otherwise, if the player has received the ball /p/ times, he'll pass the ball directly to the person *L* places to his left if /p/ is even, or *L* places to his right if /p/ is odd (see examples for clarification). Given *N*, *M* and *L*, return the number of times that the ball is passed.

##### Examples

```
5

3

2

Returns: 10

First, player 1 gets the ball. Since he has held the ball 1 time, he passes the ball to player 4, who is two places to his right. 

This is player 4's first time holding the ball, so he gives it to player 2, who passes it to player 5. Player 5 then passes the ball to player 3, who passes it back to player 1. Since player 1 has now held the ball 2 times, he passes it to player 3, who passes it to player 5, who then passes the ball to player 2. 

Finally, player 2 passes the ball to player 4, who then passes it to player 1. Player 1 has now held the ball 3 times, and the game ends.

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
My initial thought is that this problem is quite overwhelming with information so it would be best to make simple notes of what is required:

1. N = total people
2. P = number of times a person has caught the ball
3. M = max number of catches

- So, we need to be able to store key value pairs of people and number of catches, and iterate while P ~= M. 
- I think we might be able to achieve this with an unordered map, bouncing from person to person, checking P against M and updating their catches if viable. 
- First we should loop the total number of people and set their catches to 0, then start the while loop

### First Attempt

```cpp
int ThrowTheBall::timesThrown(int N, int M, int L)
{
    std::unordered_map<int, int> catches;

    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        catches[i]=0;
    }

    int j=0;
    int passes=0;

    while (catches[j] != M) {
        catches[j]++;
        passes++;
        if (catches[j] % 2 == 0) {
            j = (j - L + N) % N;
        } else {
            j = (j + L) % N;
        }
    }

    return passes;
}
```

- Doesn't seem to work as I didn't read the question properly - should be checking for total passes, not the passes of an individual. Also, need to swap behaviour for odd and even and check for passes BEFORE incrementing them. 

### Second Attempt

```cpp
int ThrowTheBall::timesThrown(int N, int M, int L)
{
    std::unordered_map<int, int> catches;

    for (int i=0; i<N; i++) {
        catches[i]=0;
    }

    int j=0;
    int passes=0;

    while (catches[j] != M) {
        if (catches[j] % 2 == 0) {
            j = (j + L) % N;
        } else {
            j = (j - L + N) % N;
        }
        catches[j]++;
        passes++;
    }

    return passes-1;
}
```

- This seems to be working now, I also needed to decrease total passes by 1 as it's counting an extra pass at the end of the while loop. 

### Reflection
- This was an interesting problem - very helpful to begin planning out from the beginning as it was difficult to translate the passing logic from my head into code without breaking it down first.
- Apparently my solution was not optimal at all... being O(n\*m) in time complexity. The better solution would be to recognise that the game ends when the ball returns to the player in position 0, the number of passes in each round is either N / L (when N is a multiple of L) or N / L + 2 (when N is not a multiple of L) and therefore:
1. If M is less than or equal to the number of passes in each round, then a player catches the ball M times before it returns to the first player. Therefore, the number of passes will be M - 1 (since we don't count the pass that ends the game).

2. If M is greater than the number of passes in each round, then the ball will be passed a certain number of times for each of the M times that the first player catches the ball, plus an additional number of times for the other players to catch the ball M times.

This would result in a O(1) complexity.
