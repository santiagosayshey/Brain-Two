## Problem Statement

```
A robot is moving in a plane following a set of instructions.


The following instructions are possible (quotes for clarity only):

"LEFT" - turn left 90 degrees

"RIGHT" - turn right 90 degrees

"TURN AROUND" - turn around (a 180 degree turn)

"LEFT X" - turn left X degrees, where X is a positive integer

"RIGHT X" - turn right X degrees, where X is a positive integer

"HALT" - stop executing instructions; further instructions are not executed


You are given a String[] containing the robot's instructions. Initially, the robot is facing north. Return the robot's final azimuth - the angle between north and the direction the robot is facing. Azimuth is always measured clockwise, and is a number between 0, inclusive, and 360, exclusive. For example, west corresponds to azimuth 270.
```
 

340

90

90-(360-aziumuth)


## Definition

```
Class:	AzimuthMonitoring
Method:	getAzimuth
Parameters:	String[]
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int getAzimuth(String[] instructions)
(be sure your method is public)
```


## Notes

```
Turning right corresponds to turning clockwise, turning left corresponds to turning counterclockwise.
```


## Constraints

-	*instructions* will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-	Each element of *instructions* will be a valid instruction, as listed
in the problem statement.
-	In an instruction of the form "LEFT X" or "RIGHT X", X will be an
integer between 1 and 179, inclusive, with no leading zeroes.
 


##### Examples

```
{"RIGHT"}

Returns: 90

Turning 90 degrees right changes the azimuth from 0 to 90.
```

```
{"LEFT", "LEFT", "TURN AROUND"}

Returns: 0

After turning left, the robot is facing west (azimuth 270). After
turning left again, the robot is facing south (azimuth 180). Finally,
turning around makes the robot face north, azimuth 0.
```

```
{"LEFT 5", "RIGHT 10", "LEFT 15", "RIGHT 20", "LEFT 25", "RIGHT 30", "LEFT 35", "RIGHT 40"}

Returns: 20

There are four pairs of instructions, each pair making the robot turn
right 5 degrees.
```

```
{"RIGHT 59", "RIGHT", "RIGHT", "HALT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT"}

Returns: 239

The fourth instruction is "HALT", thus none of the following "LEFT"
instructions are executed.
```

```
{"TURN AROUND", "HALT", "LEFT 5", "HALT", "LEFT 5", "HALT"}

Returns: 180

Note that there might be more then one "HALT" instruction.
```

```
{"LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "LEFT", "HALT"}

Returns: 270

After the first 4 turns the robot is facing north again, and the fifth
instruction turns him west. The last instruction doesn't change anything.
```


## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
- This problem seems pretty straight foward
	- Use a while loop to iterate across the vector until the string is "Halt" and keep a running count of the angle
	- If statements to check for move sets

### First Attempt
- Pretty straightforward, only difficult bit was researching how to pass strings with sstream. Other than that, was pretty straightforward.
- From the Street Parking problem I remembered to use the modulus operator for easy circular integer manipulation, shortening the code


### Reflection
- Pretty straightforward problem that let me learn a C++ tool to parse strings. 
- I can't think of any time / space improvements to my code but I think I could make it better by returning on halt instead of breaking and looping once more. 
- Not sure how to implement in C++, but my initial thought was to use regex to break the string up and easily find components.
	- This would help with the lack of uniformity with checking instruction AND word.
