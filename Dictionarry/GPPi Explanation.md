The GPPi is designed to rank release groups based on their consistent delivery of 'Golden Popcorn' quality releases for a given resolution. The formula combines a group's Golden Popcorn performance with their overall activity at that specific resolution.

## Formula

For any given resolution \( r \), the GPPi is defined as:

$$ 
GPPi_r = \frac{\left( GPE_r \right)^2}{E_r} 
$$

Where:
$$ 
\begin{align*}
GPPi_r & : \text{Golden Popcorn Performance index at resolution } r \\
GPE_r & : \text{Number of Golden Popcorn Encodes at resolution } r \\
E_r & : \text{Total encodes at resolution } r
\end{align*}
$$
