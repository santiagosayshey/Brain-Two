### Singular Categories:

1. **Efficient**:
- Focus on space efficiency
- x265 focus
- Allows AV-1 encodes
- x264 fallback
- Remux not allowed
- Lossy audio only

2. **Universal**:
- Focus on compatibility
- No new codecs
	- x/h264 only allowed
	- DD, DTS allowed
- No HDR
- Mid tier size focus, not overtly efficient but still focusing on smaller size

1. **Transparent**:
   - Focus on best available release
   - Flexible, can grab remux, encode, hdr, lossy / lossless
   - Release group

2. **Immutable**:
- Grab once, never touch again

### Combined Categories:

5. **Efficient + Universal**:
   - x264 for maximum compatibility and efficiency
   - Lower resolutions for smaller file size (e.g., 576p, 720p)
   - Lossy audio

6. **Efficient + Transparent**:
   - x265 for quality with efficiency in mind
   - High resolutions (e.g., 1080p) to maintain source quality
   - High-quality lossy audio, like high-bitrate AAC or OGG

7. **Efficient + Immutable**:
   - x265 WEB sources
   - Lossy audio
   - x264 web as a fallback
   - Avoiding Blu-ray due to potential size and future source upgrades

8. **Universal + Transparent**:
   - x264 for compatibility
   - High resolutions to retain quality (e.g., 1080p)
   - Lossless or high-bitrate lossy audio

9. **Universal + Immutable**:
   - x264 with widely accepted resolutions (e.g., 1080p)
   - Standard audio formats
   - Avoiding niche or evolving formats for the sake of longevity

10. **Transparent + Immutable**:
   - High resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 4K) that won't feel outdated
   - Lossless audio for enduring quality
   - Stable, widely-accepted formats

11. **Efficient + Universal + Transparent**:
   - x265, considering it's efficient but retains quality
   - Higher-end of standard resolutions (e.g., 1080p)
   - High-quality lossy audio

12. **Efficient + Universal + Immutable**:
   - x265 WEB sources for efficiency and longevity
   - Lossy audio
   - Fallback to x264 WEB sources
   - Avoiding potential future upgrades like Blu-ray

13. **Efficient + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x265 with high resolutions to maximize quality and efficiency
   - High-quality lossy audio
   - Skipping sources that might prompt future upgrades

14. **Universal + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x264 with high resolutions like 1080p for enduring quality
   - Stable audio formats that are also of high quality

15. **Efficient + Universal + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x265, given its efficiency and quality retention
   - High resolutions like 1080p to ensure longevity and quality
   - High-quality lossy audio to balance size and quality
   - Sticking to universally accepted formats and sources

Each combination tries to balance the priorities of the categories, but there will always be a trade-off. This is a broad representation, and individual preferences may tweak these choices slightly.
