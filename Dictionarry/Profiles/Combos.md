### Singular Categories:

1. **Efficient**:
   - x265 primary focus
   - Lossy audio formats (e.g., DD, DD+, DTS, OPUS)
   - x264 as a fallback if x265 is not available

2. **Universal**:
   - x264 for broad compatibility
   - Lossy audio formats (e.g., DD, DD, DTS, OPUS)
   - Resolutions that are universally accepted, like 720p

3. **Transparent**:
   - High resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 4K)
   - Lossless audio (e.g., FLAC, DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD)
   - Best available source, often Blu-ray or UHD Blu-ray

4. **Immutable**:
   - Stable, widely-accepted codecs like x264
   - High enough quality for longevity, like 1080p
   - Mainstream audio formats that won't feel outdated soon

### Combined Categories:

5. **Efficient + Universal**:
   - x264 for maximum compatibility and efficiency
   - Lower resolutions for smaller file size (e.g., 576p, 720p)
   - Lossy audio

6. **Efficient + Transparent**:
   - x265 for quality with efficiency in mind
   - High resolutions (e.g., 1080p) to maintain source quality
   - High-quality lossy audio, like high-bitrate AAC or OGG

7. **Efficient + Immutable**:
   - x265 WEB sources
   - Lossy audio
   - x264 web as a fallback
   - Avoiding Blu-ray due to potential size and future source upgrades

8. **Universal + Transparent**:
   - x264 for compatibility
   - High resolutions to retain quality (e.g., 1080p)
   - Lossless or high-bitrate lossy audio

9. **Universal + Immutable**:
   - x264 with widely accepted resolutions (e.g., 1080p)
   - Standard audio formats
   - Avoiding niche or evolving formats for the sake of longevity

10. **Transparent + Immutable**:
   - High resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 4K) that won't feel outdated
   - Lossless audio for enduring quality
   - Stable, widely-accepted formats

11. **Efficient + Universal + Transparent**:
   - x265, considering it's efficient but retains quality
   - Higher-end of standard resolutions (e.g., 1080p)
   - High-quality lossy audio

12. **Efficient + Universal + Immutable**:
   - x265 WEB sources for efficiency and longevity
   - Lossy audio
   - Fallback to x264 WEB sources
   - Avoiding potential future upgrades like Blu-ray

13. **Efficient + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x265 with high resolutions to maximize quality and efficiency
   - High-quality lossy audio
   - Skipping sources that might prompt future upgrades

14. **Universal + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x264 with high resolutions like 1080p for enduring quality
   - Stable audio formats that are also of high quality

15. **Efficient + Universal + Transparent + Immutable**:
   - x265, given its efficiency and quality retention
   - High resolutions like 1080p to ensure longevity and quality
   - High-quality lossy audio to balance size and quality
   - Sticking to universally accepted formats and sources

Each combination tries to balance the priorities of the categories, but there will always be a trade-off. This is a broad representation, and individual preferences may tweak these choices slightly.
