## Transparent

1. **Resolution & Codec**: Rooted in 1080p x264 encodes based on user preference, this profile balances transparency and universality. Whether it's pristine clarity or broader compatibility, this profile delivers on both fronts.

2. **Fallback Mechanism**: For newly released movies, if the preferred resolution (1080p) isn't available either via WEB or Blu-ray releases, an SD version will be sought as the fallback, ensuring thereâ€™s always content to grab.

3. **Codec Exclusion**: Prioritizing broad compatibility, x264 is the preferred codec, deliberately side-lining x265.

4. **HDR Status**: With an observant eye on HDR's proliferation, this profile consciously sidesteps, ensuring content remains accessible and consistent across a broad spectrum of devices.

5. **Universality**: Geared for expansive reach, the 1080p choices guarantee compatibility from legacy devices to the newest streaming platforms.

6. **Audio**: Striking a balance between clarity and compatibility. While lossy formats like DTS and Dolby Digital (AC3) lead the way, the inclusion of Atmos with DD+ tracks reinforces the commitment to quality.

7. **Release Groups & GPPi**: Relying on established reputations, the profile leans on release groups with stellar track records, underpinned by the GPPi's insights.

8. **Compatibility**: Rooted in universality, this profile faces minimal compatibility hitches across trackers and playback mediums, ensuring a seamless experience.

9. **Summary**: A blend of transparency and broad reach, tailored for those desiring quality at their preferred HD resolution without compatibility constraints.
