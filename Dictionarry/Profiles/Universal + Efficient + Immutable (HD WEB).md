A profile tailor-made for users who desire a simple, one-and-done approach. By focusing on WEB releases, this profile ensures wide compatibility with devices while being space-conscious. Given its immutable nature, once content is grabbed, users can rest assured that there won't be any future upgrades or changes, reducing the need for micromanagement.

1. **Resolution & Codec**: Emphasizes on WEB releases, which often come in resolutions like 720p or 1080p, encoded in x264 for optimum compatibility and size efficiency.

2. **One-Time Grab**: With its immutable quality, there's no cycle of upgrades. Once a movie or show episode is obtained, it remains as the definitive version in the user's collection.

3. **Compatibility First**: Prioritizes formats and encodes that play well across a broad spectrum of devices, from smart TVs to mobile devices.

4. **Efficiency**: By leveraging WEB releases and avoiding higher-tiered sources like UHD or Remuxes, this profile conserves bandwidth and storage space.

5. **Summary**: Ideal for those who seek a straightforward experience, this profile embodies a "set it and forget it" philosophy, merging the best of compatibility, efficiency, and stability.
