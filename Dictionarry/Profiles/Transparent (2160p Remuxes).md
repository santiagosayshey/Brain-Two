**Primary Objective**: To provide the most genuine viewing experience that mirrors the original intentions of the content creators, without any compromise.

1. **Resolution**: The central focus is on 2160p (4K), ensuring viewers are presented with maximum detail and clarity.

2. **HDR Capabilities**: Prioritization is given to releases featuring both HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. These formats guarantee exceptional dynamic range, colour vibrancy, and an enhanced visual experience.

3. **New Movie Contingency**: For newly released movies, it's a common trend to witness their debut on streaming platforms prior to their availability on physical or UHD formats. Recognizing this, the "Transparent" profile initially seeks out and acquires the best possible WEB 2160p release, with Movies Anywhere being the top-tier preference among streaming services. However, it's important to note that these WEB releases act as placeholders. Once the UHD remux versions become available, they are automatically prioritized for upgrade, ensuring that the final library consists of the highest quality content.

4. **Audio**: Our preference leans toward a rich auditory experience, ideally embedded with DTS-X or TrueHD + Atmos. However, it's crucial to highlight the distinction in audio offerings between UHD remuxes and WEB releases. While UHD remuxes are characterized by their pristine audio tracks, WEB releases predominantly feature lossy audio, particularly DD+ with Atmos. To avoid unintentional acquisition of hybrid encodes — combinations of WEB video and UHD disc-derived lossless audio — the "Transparent" profile expressly blacklists lossless audio for WEB releases.

5. **Selection Methodology**: The approach is A/V feature-centric, placing little impactful emphasis on release groups. This strategy caters to trackers, notably PTP, which don’t routinely specify release groups. This ensures the selection of content for its unparalleled A/V features, irrespective of the source or tracker.

6. **File Size Considerations**: Remuxes, being unadulterated replicas of the original UHD discs, are substantially larger in file size compared to their encoded counterparts. This is an aspect potential users should be aware of when opting for this profile.

7. **Release Groups**: The term 'remux' has witnessed an evolution, with 'hybrid' remuxes now in the fray. These hybrids merge features from WEB DV, introduce external subtitles, and occasionally even custom HDR grades. Within this sphere, the release group WiLDCAT stands as the gold standard, renowned for their impeccable hybrid remuxes. Their sporadic release frequency means that other groups such as FRaMeSToR, TRiToN, and others also get a nod.

8. **Indexer Priority**: Not all trackers are created equal. The unique nuances and occasional parsing errors make it imperative to rank trackers. HDBits, with their exclusive content from groups like 3L, and PTP, with its rigorous quality control and trumping systems, are prioritized. This methodology ensures the highest quality releases get the spotlight.

9. **Compatibility & Limitations**: While this profile is primed for universal compatibility with 4K HDR-enabled devices, it does face an operational hiccup with UHDBits due to the absence of audio tags in their API.
