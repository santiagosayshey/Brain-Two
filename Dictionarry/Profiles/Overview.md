### Transparent

- **Description**: A dynamic profile singularly focused on delivering the finest release possible. Grounded in data, "Transparent" evolves continually to select the release most likely to attain a 'Golden Popcorn' status. Rather than being bound by isolated audio or video quality metrics, this profile places trust in the reputations and track records of release groups. By leveraging a unique metric, the Golden Popcorn Performance Index (GPPi), "Transparent" harnesses historical data to identify release groups known for their consistent output of top-tier quality at a specific resolution, effectively balancing between resolution, quality, and potential source defects.

## GPPi: The Decision Engine

The GPPi is a calculated metric, pivotal to the "Transparent" profile's decision-making process. It's engineered to rank release groups based on their consistent delivery of 'Golden Popcorn' quality releases for a given resolution. The formula is a delicate interplay between a group's Golden Popcorn performance and their overall release activity at that resolution.

## Formula

For any given resolution *r*, the GPPi is defined as:

$$ 
GPPi_r = \frac{\left( GPE_r \right)^2}{E_r} 
$$

Where:
$$ 
\begin{align*}
GPPi_r & : \text{Golden Popcorn Performance index at resolution } r \\
GPE_r & : \text{Number of Golden Popcorn Encodes at resolution } r \\
E_r & : \text{Total encodes at resolution } r
\end{align*}
$$

### Universal
- **Description**: A profile focused on compatibility. Selects versions that are optimized for the widest range of devices and applications. Ensures a hassle-free playback experience on most platforms.

### Immutable
- **Description**: Designed for users who prioritize a one-time, optimal download. It targets a balance between quality and file size, ensuring the best ratio without the need for subsequent upgrades.

### Non-Technical Name for "Remux":

- **PureCut** or **DirectCut**
    - **Description**: A version of the movie or show taken directly from its source (like a Blu-Ray) without any alterations to the video or audio quality. It offers an untouched, high-fidelity experience.

(Note: While "PureCut" or "DirectCut" may be more user-friendly terms, it's essential to ensure that users understand what they're getting, especially if they're accustomed to the term "remux.")
