## Overview
Dedicated to ensuring an uncompromised playback experience, the "Universal" profile zeroes in on versions tailored for the broadest array of devices and platforms. Instead of merely chasing top-tier quality or resolution, "Universal" prioritizes compatibility. By doing so, it assures a seamless viewing experience irrespective of the playback medium, be it a smartphone, a digital media player, a smart TV, or any other device. Still, within this constraint, it remains diligent in seeking a harmonious balance between quality and file size.

## The Universal Selection Process

At the heart of the "Universal" profile lies its acute understanding of the release landscape. Recognizing that not all releases are born equal, it has been tuned to prefer web releases, which have traditionally been optimized for a wider range of playback devices. However, the profile isn't rigid; when web releases are elusive, it defaults to the next best optionâ€”a stream-optimized Blu-ray encode. 

### 1. Web Releases: The Universal Standard
   - **Why Web Releases?**: Given their native format, web releases are innately tailored for digital playback across devices. This makes them a natural fit for the "Universal" profile. They encapsulate good quality, reasonable file size, and above all, broad compatibility.
   - **Quality within Constraints**: While compatibility is paramount, the profile doesn't compromise on quality. It continually seeks web releases that offer the best video and audio quality within the set file size constraints.

### 2. Stream-Optimized Blu-ray Encodes: The Fallback 
   - **The Logic**: Even in the absence of web releases, the "Universal" profile remains committed to its compatibility promise. Stream-optimized Blu-ray encodes, with their compact file sizes and good quality, serve as a reliable fallback.
   - **Prioritizing Smooth Playback**: The focus remains on ensuring a buffer-free and smooth playback. Hence, even among Blu-ray encodes, the profile selects ones optimized for streaming, making them compatible with a wider set of devices and platforms.

### 3. Quality, File Size, and Compatibility: The Delicate Balance
   - **Juggling Priorities**: The "Universal" profile acknowledges the competing priorities of quality, file size, and compatibility. However, it is engineered to find that sweet spot where all three criteria meet, ensuring viewers enjoy a quality viewing experience that plays effortlessly across devices.
