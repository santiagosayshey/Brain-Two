## Immutable: The One-Time Decision Sub-Profile

"Immutable" isn't about a specific quality or encoding technique but about commitment. Once a decision is made, there's no looking back. Whether prioritizing the finest quality, compatibility, or efficiency, the "Immutable" characteristic ensures that once a release is grabbed, there are no further upgrades based on evolving scores or better versions.

## Key Characteristics of Immutable:

### 1. One Grab Policy:
   - **First and Final**: Once a release is selected and grabbed based on the primary profile's criteria (be it "Transparent", "Universal", or "Efficient"), no subsequent releases for the same content are considered, even if they might score higher or offer a different set of features.
   - **Consistency over Evolution**: While other profiles may continually evolve their selections based on new data or releases, the "Immutable" sub-profile remains steadfast in its first choice.

### 2. Storage Stability:
   - **Predictable Footprint**: There's no risk of additional storage being used for the same content due to upgrades. Once a file is downloaded, its space requirement remains constant, offering a more predictable storage management experience.
   
### 3. Simplified Management:
   - **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: With no upgrades to track or manage, users can have a more hands-off approach to their media collection. There's no need to continually monitor or adjust preferences for better versions.

### 4. Trust in Initial Choice:
   - **Relying on First Impressions**: The underlying principle of "Immutable" is trust in the initial selection process. By adhering to the primary profile's guidelines, be it based on group reputation, compatibility, or efficiency, the "Immutable" characteristic assumes that the first choice was the right choice.

## **Side Note on Combining 'Immutable' with Other Profiles**:

While the "Immutable" characteristic can seamlessly integrate with most primary profiles, there's a specific caveat when it comes to "Transparent". 

**Transparent's Essence**: The very core of the "Transparent" profile lies in its dynamic nature. It thrives on the ongoing evolution of releases, allowing it to select the most superior quality by leveraging historical data and group reputations. By introducing an "Immutable" aspect to "Transparent", one would be contradicting the profile's foundational goal.

**Best Fits**:
- **Efficient**: Especially for those who prioritize a balance between quality and file size. Once the best efficient release is grabbed, there's no need to reassess based on future releases.
- **Universal**: Tailored for casual torrenters who value compatibility and hassle-free playback across devices. An "Immutable" characteristic ensures they get a universally compatible file and stick with it.
