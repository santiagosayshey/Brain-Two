1. **Resolution & Source**: Tailored for the enthusiasts who seek undiluted clarity without the clutter of upgrades or the task of micro-managing, this profile is centered on 1080p Blu-ray Remuxes. Given the nature of remuxes, which are direct copies from the source, the chance of hybrid versions is virtually null, so the content you get is authentic and unaltered.

2. **No Upgrades**: As the name suggests, "Immutable" implies stability. Once a movie or show is downloaded, there's no subsequent hunt for a 'better' version. It's a one-time grab, ensuring peace of mind for the users and stability in their collections.

3. **Audio**: True to its transparent roots, this profile banks on the uncompressed multi-channel audio, usually present in remuxes, to ensure a theater-like auditory experience. Whether it's DTS-HD MA, TrueHD Atmos, or their equivalents, you're sure to get the authentic sound.

4. **Release Groups**: While remuxes are direct copies and generally consistent, some release groups are known for their meticulous metadata management, proper subtitle inclusion, and overall packaging. Such groups are prioritized, ensuring a holistic experience.

5. **Compatibility**: Given that this profile centers around uncompressed 1080p content, playback devices need to have decent capabilities. Modern TVs, home theater PCs, and most streaming boxes would handle these releases effortlessly.

6. **Storage Implications**: While offering pristine quality, remuxes demand a fair bit of storage space. It's ideal for users with adequate storage solutions who value purity over size.

7. **Summary**: The Transparent + Immutable profile is the perfect match for purists who cherish quality and despise the cyclic chase of upgrades. It's a set-and-forget solution, ensuring that once content is added, it remains the best version you can get.
