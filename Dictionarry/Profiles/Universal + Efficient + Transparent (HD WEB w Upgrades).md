Designed for users who aim for the best within the WEB release category, this profile combines wide compatibility, space-conscious efficiency, and commitment to improving qualityâ€”all while staying strictly within the realm of WEB releases.

1. **Resolution & Codec**: Emphasizes on WEB releases, focusing primarily on resolutions like 720p or 1080p, encoded in x264 for broad compatibility and efficient file sizes.

2. **Evolution Within Limits**: While rooted in its commitment to the WEB tier, this profile allows for upgrades. For instance, as better WEB sources become available, an initial iTunes release might be upgraded to an Amazon version and eventually to a "Movies Anywhere" release, ensuring you're always inching closer to the best within the WEB category.

3. **Compatibility First**: Prioritizes formats and encodes that are universally compatible, from smart TVs to mobile devices.

4. **Efficiency**: By focusing solely on WEB releases and avoiding higher-tiered sources, bandwidth and storage consumption remain relatively conservative.

5. **Transparency in Upgrades**: It's not just about grabbing any WEB release; it's about evolving toward the best one. This progression ensures a transparent improvement in quality over time.

6. **Summary**: Perfect for those who seek a blend of quality progression, device compatibility, and storage efficiency. This profile ensures you get the best of the WEB tier, continually refining your collection without having to juggle multiple formats or resolutions.
