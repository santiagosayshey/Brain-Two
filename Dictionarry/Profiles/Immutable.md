## Immutable: The One-Time Decision Sub-Profile

"Immutable" isn't about a specific quality or encoding technique but about commitment. Once a decision is made, there's no looking back. Whether prioritizing the finest quality, compatibility, or efficiency, the "Immutable" characteristic ensures that once a release is grabbed, there are no further upgrades based on evolving scores or better versions. It's for those who trust the initial judgment and see value in consistency.

### Key Characteristics of Immutable:

### 1. One Grab Policy:
   - **First and Final**: Once a release is selected and grabbed based on the primary profile's criteria (be it "Transparent", "Universal", or "Efficient"), no subsequent releases for the same content are considered, even if they might score higher or offer a different set of features.
   - **Consistency over Evolution**: While other profiles may continually evolve their selections based on new data or releases, the "Immutable" sub-profile remains steadfast in its first choice.

### 2. Storage Stability:
   - **Predictable Footprint**: There's no risk of additional storage being used for the same content due to upgrades. Once a file is downloaded, its space requirement remains constant, offering a more predictable storage management experience.
   
### 3. Simplified Management:
   - **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: With no upgrades to track or manage, users can have a more hands-off approach to their media collection. There's no need to continually monitor or adjust preferences for better versions.

### 4. Trust in Initial Choice:
   - **Relying on First Impressions**: The underlying principle of "Immutable" is trust in the initial selection process. By adhering to the primary profile's guidelines, be it based on group reputation, compatibility, or efficiency, the "Immutable" characteristic assumes that the first choice was the right choice.

Applying the "Immutable" characteristic ensures a steadfast approach to media collection. It's the perfect add-on for those who value stability and trust in their selection process. Whether combined with "Transparent", "Universal", or "Efficient", it offers a unique layer of consistency.
