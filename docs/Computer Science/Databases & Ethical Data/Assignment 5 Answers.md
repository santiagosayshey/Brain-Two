> *What is ChatGPT?*

To answer this question, it's important to first define a few key ideas related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

***Artificial Intelligence*** is a branch of Computer Science focused on replicating human intelligence in machines. This is realised through some sort of engineered system that is designed to learn from various inputs and make decisions based on their interpretation of these inputs.

***Machine Learning*** is a branch of AI that specifically utilises algorithms to learn from data and make predictions based on that data.

_**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**_ is another subset of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Many of its tasks, such as language comprehension and generation, often harness machine learning techniques to enhance their capabilities.

_**Large Language Models (LLMs)**_ are a type of generative AI that are specifically designed to process and generate human-like text to solve NLP problems. 

***ChatGPT*** is an ***LLM*** that aims to understand and generate text in a conversational manner.
