> *What is ChatGPT?*

To answer this question, it's important to first define a few key ideas related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

***Artificial Intelligence*** is a subset of Computer Science focused on replicating human intelligence in machines. This is often achieved through the creation of an engineered system that is designed to learn from some kind of input and make decisions based on it's own understanding

***Machine Learning*** is a subset of AI that specifically utilises algorithms to learn from data and make predictions based on that data.

_**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**_ is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It plays a crucial role in tasks like language understanding and generation.

_**Large Language Models (LLMs)**_ are a type of generative AI that are specifically designed to process and generate human-like text to solve NLP problems. 

***ChatGPT*** is a specific application of AI that combines elements of machine learning and natural language processing
