> ***What is ChatGPT?***

To answer this question, it's essential to first define a few key ideas related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

***Artificial Intelligence*** is a subset of Computer Science that focuses on replicating human intelligence in machines. This is achieved through an engineered system that is designed to learn from various inputs and make decisions based on their interpretation of these inputs.

_**Machine Learning**_, a branch of AI, uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions based on that data.

_**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**_ is another branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Many of its tasks, such as language comprehension and generation, often harness machine learning techniques to enhance their capabilities.

_**Large Language Models (LLMs)**_ are a type of generative AI that are specifically designed to process and generate human-like text to solve NLP problems. 

***ChatGPT*** is an ***LLM*** built by OpenAI that aims to understand and generate text in a conversational manner.

> ***What Does ChatGPT Do?***


ChatGPT stands as an advanced conversational interface, designed to replicate human-like dialogue experiences. It seamlessly engages users, answers inquiries, addresses follow-up questions, challenges inaccuracies, and executes diverse tasks like text composition, code generation, and even image creation. Its intuitive and approachable user interface mimics familiar messaging paradigms, making it user-friendly and adaptable to varied interactive scenarios.

While ChatGPT itself is anchored to its training data and doesn't inherently search the internet, over time, it's core capabilities have been refined and broadened through the integration of plugins. For instance, when coupled with plugins like Wolfram Alpha, ChatGPT's computational and data querying potential is significantly amplified.
