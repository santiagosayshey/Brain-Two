### Question 1 (5 marks): 

```
Has OpenAI's **latest** version of ChatGPT sourced all of its training data ethically? You must support your answer with clear explanations, sound logic, and referenced evidence. (Also, make sure you identify which version you're talking about. You will be using 3.5, as noted below, but is this the latest version?)
```

This question is impossible to definitively answer. At best, it can be said that there exists undeniable evidence that highlights issues with the way in which the data used to train GPT-3 and 4 was sourced, but this evidence lacks the context of intent. 

According to Brown et al. (2020), GPT-3 was primarily trained through the web scraping of the Common Crawl and WebText datasets, as well as online book collections Books1 & Books2 & Wikipedia. Furthermore, according to OpenAI's own privacy policy, user conversations and additional data is further used to train the models. This data is then refined through undisclosed methods to remove bias and redundant information. While the specifics of the sources in which GPT-4 was trained is not currently known, it can be assumed that the existing data set was used in addition with new

### Question 2 (5 marks)

```
You should create an account and connect to ChatGPT. The free access plan allows you to use ChatGPT 3.5, which is the version that we wish you to use for this assignment. Find a short poem in the public domain, 8 lines long, and type/paste the first 6 lines into ChatGPT. What does ChatGPT do when you do this? 

Ask ChatGPT to add two more lines that are as different as possible from the first six. 

Analyse the two lines you have been given and propose an explanation for why those lines were produced.

You should include either an image or the text of your interaction with ChatGPT.
```
### Question 3 (5 marks)

```
Find out from ChatGPT 3.5 how current its information is. List at least two things that might be incorrect or incomplete. You may need to ask it several questions to get these answers.
```

### Question 4 (10 marks)

```
By default, ChatGPT just gives you answers, with no indication of the degree to which the answer is supported by evidence, nor whether there is disagreement over the answer. In this question we want you to:

- Propose a scale for how much a claim is supported by evidence
- Propose a scale for how much disagreement there is over a particular claim
- Use conversational interaction with ChatGPT to get it to provide answers on both scales whenever it answers you

Your submitted answer should include a clear statement of both scales, why you have chosen them, and both the frame you used to get ChatGPT to use the scales and clear evidence of the frames in action. You may find [this reference](https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/scales-of-measurement/)
