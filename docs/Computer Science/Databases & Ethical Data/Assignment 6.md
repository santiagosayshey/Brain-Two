### Question 1 (5 marks): 

```
Has OpenAI's **latest** version of ChatGPT sourced all of its training data ethically? You must support your answer with clear explanations, sound logic, and referenced evidence. (Also, make sure you identify which version you're talking about. You will be using 3.5, as noted below, but is this the latest version?)
```

This question is impossible to definitively answer. At best, it can be said that there exists undeniable evidence that highlights issues with the way in which the data used to train GPT-3 and 4 was sourced, but this evidence lacks the context of intent.

According to Brown et al. (2020), GPT-3 was primarily trained through the web scraping of the Common Crawl, WebText datasets, as well as online book collections Books1 & Books2 & Wikipedia. 

Moving on to GPT-4, although specific details regarding its training sources remain undisclosed, given the massive increase in parameters from GPT-3's 175 billion to GPT-4's 100 trillion, as noted in [this article](https://simplified.com/blog/ai-writing/chatgpt-vs-gpt-3/), it can be inferred that it may have incorporated a broader range of sources. 

Furthermore, OpenAI's own privacy policy reveals that user interactions also play a role in refining the model. An opt-out for users who don't want their data to be used is provided, however, it's worth noting that while this opt-out option exists, many users might not be aware of it. OpenAI's proactive approach could be questioned here: if they genuinely prioritise ethical considerations, should they not actively inform users of their right to opt-out? Is simply having an opt-out clause buried somewhere in the terms and conditions sufficient?

As these datasets are massive compilations of online content, there are inherent challenges in ensuring every piece of information is ethically sourced, free of bias, or completely accurate.

The process of refining training data to remove bias is an intricate endeavour. No matter how advanced the refining methods are, there will always be nuances, subtleties, and cultural contexts that can introduce biases in the results. It's akin to filtering water: while larger contaminants can be removed, microscopic elements may still permeate. This raises a critical question: Can a model ever truly be unbiased, given the vast and diverse nature of the data it's trained on?



Regardless, we must question the value of intent for such a complex debate. Does any of this matter in the context of OpenAI's goal?

### Question 2 (5 marks)

```
You should create an account and connect to ChatGPT. The free access plan allows you to use ChatGPT 3.5, which is the version that we wish you to use for this assignment. Find a short poem in the public domain, 8 lines long, and type/paste the first 6 lines into ChatGPT. What does ChatGPT do when you do this? 

Ask ChatGPT to add two more lines that are as different as possible from the first six. 

Analyse the two lines you have been given and propose an explanation for why those lines were produced.

You should include either an image or the text of your interaction with ChatGPT.
```
### Question 3 (5 marks)

```
Find out from ChatGPT 3.5 how current its information is. List at least two things that might be incorrect or incomplete. You may need to ask it several questions to get these answers.
```

### Question 4 (10 marks)

```
By default, ChatGPT just gives you answers, with no indication of the degree to which the answer is supported by evidence, nor whether there is disagreement over the answer. In this question we want you to:

- Propose a scale for how much a claim is supported by evidence
- Propose a scale for how much disagreement there is over a particular claim
- Use conversational interaction with ChatGPT to get it to provide answers on both scales whenever it answers you

Your submitted answer should include a clear statement of both scales, why you have chosen them, and both the frame you used to get ChatGPT to use the scales and clear evidence of the frames in action. You may find [this reference](https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/scales-of-measurement/)
