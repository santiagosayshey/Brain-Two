1. What ChatGPT is

```
- "ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by OpenAI, which allow people to interact in a conversational way."
- "They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech."
- "GPT stands for ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’, which refers to how these bots process requests and formulate responses."

```

```
"ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) a natural language processing (NLP) model (OpenAI, 2023)."

```

```
- "ChatGPT is one of a number of ‘large language models’ (LLM) that are currently undergoing development and training."
- "It has a conversational interface where a user provides a ‘prompt’ that will generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics."

```


2. What it does
   
```
- "Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs."
- "ChatGPT can only provide answers based on the information it has been trained with and does not have the ability to search the internet for new information."

```

```
"Models such as ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text data and can generate human like content in response to user prompts with high levels of accuracy."

https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/340044691/340044193_Published_article.pdf
```

```
"It can generate fluent and often highly convincing answers to many questions."

4. How ChatGPT was trained and where that data came from
   
```
"Models such as ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text data..."

https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/340044691/340044193_Published_article.pdf
```

```
- ChatGPT is able to generate text as it is trained on enormous amounts of data scraped from the internet."
- "Different training sets will create different suggestions for the same prompt, and it should be noted that as the model develops and the training set expands, a greater variety of options will be generated."
- "The training data has not been explicitly curated for accuracy or for any specific use case."

https://lsbc.vic.gov.au/news-updates/news/generative-ai-and-lawyers
```

```
"Both models have been trained with huge amounts of data and use human feedback and reward models to rank the best responses."

```

5. How ChatGPT stores its interaction data
   
```
"ChatGPT is also continuously being trained by users inputting prompts, unless the user specifically opts out. It not only learns about the quality of the output by asking the user to rank the answers given, but it also further saves and labels the original prompt."

```
   
6. What any ethical issues are
   
```
- "The use of AI and advanced technologies in health care has created ongoing ethical, moral, and legal debates."
- "Concerns raised relevant to nursing and midwifery programs relate to potentiating the existing theory practice gap and amplifying the high tech/high touch conundrum."

https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/340044691/340044193_Published_article.pdf
```


```
"You should also bear in mind that ChatGPT gives no guarantee that it will keep your information confidential."

7. What any possible legal issues are
   
```

```

```
"ChatGPT is a generalist tool – it is not specifically trained to work with legal resources or to provide accurate legal answers."

8. A short set of guidelines for best practice when using ChatGPT
   
```
The implementation of ChatGPT and other advanced technologies in higher education should not be viewed as the death knell for traditional learning. With discriminate use, and albeit with its own set of challenges, by adopting ChatGPT, higher education has an opportunity to deliver content that is more evolved and learner-centred than ever before.

```

```
- "You should note that ChatGPT is a generalist tool – it is not specifically trained to work with legal resources or to provide accurate legal answers."
- "We recommend that you take steps to gain a basic understanding of generative AI, its uses and risks."
- "It has potential to help lawyers in many tasks involving text, content and idea generation, but it is a tool that should be used very carefully."
- "You need a clear understanding of its inherent limitations and your responsibilities when using any generative AI tool in the course of your work."
- "Review the terms of use carefully, and note that you can opt out of your data being used for the purposes of improving and training the AI."
- "Even if you do opt out, given the early stage of development and the evidence of AI’s emergent capabilities, you still should not submit confidential information when using it to generate text."
