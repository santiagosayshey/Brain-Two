1. What ChatGPT is

```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by [OpenAIExternal link](https://openai.com/), which allow people to interact in a conversational way

```
"ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) a natural language processing (NLP) model (OpenAI, 2023)."

```

```
- "ChatGPT is one of a number of ‘large language models’ (LLM) that are currently undergoing development and training."
- "It has a conversational interface where a user provides a ‘prompt’ that will generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics."

2. What it does
   
```
They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech. Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs.

```
"Models such as ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text data and can generate human like content in response to user prompts with high levels of accuracy."

"It can generate fluent and often highly convincing answers to many questions."

```
- ChatGPT is able to generate text as it is trained on enormous amounts of data scraped from the internet."
- "Different training sets will create different suggestions for the same prompt, and it should be noted that as the model develops and the training set expands, a greater variety of options will be generated."
- "The training data has not been explicitly curated for accuracy or for any specific use case."

6. What any ethical issues are
   
```
- "The use of AI and advanced technologies in health care has created ongoing ethical, moral, and legal debates."
- "Concerns raised relevant to nursing and midwifery programs relate to potentiating the existing theory practice gap and amplifying the high tech/high touch conundrum."

8. A short set of guidelines for best practice when using ChatGPT
   
```
The implementation of ChatGPT and other advanced technologies in higher education should not be viewed as the death knell for traditional learning. With discriminate use, and albeit with its own set of challenges, by adopting ChatGPT, higher education has an opportunity to deliver content that is more evolved and learner-centred than ever before.
