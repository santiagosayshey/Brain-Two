1. What ChatGPT is

```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by [OpenAIExternal link](https://openai.com/), which allow people to interact in a conversational way. They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech

GPT stands for ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’, which refers to how these bots process requests and formulate responses.

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are also available as APIs or application programming interfaces that can be integrated into other apps and online services.

2. What it does
   
```
Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs.

ChatGPT can only provide answers based on the information it has been trained with and does not have the ability to search the internet for new information. However, GPT-4 (the latest language model from OpenAI) can be connected to the internet via plugins, giving it the power to search for information and datasets online

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are used for: content sharing, encrypted, gaming, in-app purchasing, location sharing, messaging/online chat, screen capture and voice chat.

3. A short history of large language models
   
   
   
4. How ChatGPT was trained and where that data came from
   
```
Both models have been trained with huge amounts of data and use human feedback and reward models to rank the best responses.

5. How ChatGPT stores its interaction data
   

   
6. What any ethical issues are
   
```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 have certain limitations, as OpenAI makes clear, including sometimes writing answers that sound believable but are factually inaccurate, giving biased responses and the risk that they may action inappropriate or harmful requests.

7. What any possible legal issues are
   
```
They may also infringe intellectual copyright by incorporating content without permission and not attributing content.

8. A short set of guidelines for best practice when using ChatGPT

```
Manage your data
Outlines ways to manage your data, including turning off your chat history and choosing which conversations can be used to train AI models.

```

```
- Data anonymisation: Replace or alter personal information in the text using information that cannot be linked to the individual.
- Data masking: Replace personal information in the text, such as email addresses or phone numbers, with fictional data that retains the same format.
- Include only relevant data: Choose only information that is relevant.

verify and edit AI generated content to ensure accuracy and suitability of the output

Writing a clear and effective prompt can greatly improve the quality of output from generative AI tools, while also reducing errors or irrelevant responses. Provide clear roles and examples when creating a prompt, which involves defining a character and role for the AI tool, giving a clear task, providing examples and additional guidelines, specifying the type of output required, and including any extra phrases to improve the prompt. These steps help the AI model understand the task more accurately and produce results that meet the required specifications.
