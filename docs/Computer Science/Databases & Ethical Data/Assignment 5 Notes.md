1. What ChatGPT is

```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by [OpenAIExternal link](https://openai.com/), which allow people to interact in a conversational way

```
"ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) a natural language processing (NLP) model (OpenAI, 2023)."

```

```
- "ChatGPT is one of a number of ‘large language models’ (LLM) that are currently undergoing development and training."
- "It has a conversational interface where a user provides a ‘prompt’ that will generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics."

2. What it does
   
```
They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech. Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs.

```
"Models such as ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text data and can generate human like content in response to user prompts with high levels of accuracy."
