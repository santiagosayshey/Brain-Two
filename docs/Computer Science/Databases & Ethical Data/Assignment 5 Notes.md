1. What ChatGPT is

```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by [OpenAIExternal link](https://openai.com/), which allow people to interact in a conversational way. They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech

GPT stands for ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’, which refers to how these bots process requests and formulate responses.

2. What it does
   
```
Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs.

ChatGPT can only provide answers based on the information it has been trained with and does not have the ability to search the internet for new information. However, GPT-4 (the latest language model from OpenAI) can be connected to the internet via plugins, giving it the power to search for information and datasets online

4. How ChatGPT was trained and where that data came from
   
```
Both models have been trained with huge amounts of data and use human feedback and reward models to rank the best responses.
