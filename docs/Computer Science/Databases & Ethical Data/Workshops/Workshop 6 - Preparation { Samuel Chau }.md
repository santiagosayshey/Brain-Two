## Question 1

```
List four physical threats and how you would protect from attacks on those vectors.
```

1. Natural Disasters:
- **Threat**: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or tornadoes can cause significant damage to physical infrastructures, leading to data loss or disruption in services.
- **Protection**: Implement disaster recovery plans that include off-site backups and redundant systems located in different geographical areas. Regularly test disaster recovery plans to ensure they work effectively. Also, use physical barriers and protections designed for specific types of disasters (e.g., flood barriers, earthquake-resistant building designs).

2. Fires:
- **Threat**: Fires can destroy hardware, data, and entire facilities. They can be caused by various factors, including electrical issues, natural events, or accidents.
- **Protection**: Install fire detection (smoke detectors) and suppression systems (sprinklers or gas-based systems) throughout the facility. Use fireproof materials for critical infrastructure where possible. Regularly inspect and maintain electrical systems and manage flammable materials responsibly. Again, off-site backups are critical for data recovery.

3. Electrical Outages:
- **Threat**: Power outages can disrupt operations, cause data loss, or damage systems through improper shutdowns or power surges.
- **Protection**: Use uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for critical systems to allow for proper shutdown or continued operations during short outages. Implement backup generators to provide power during extended outages. Employ surge protectors to prevent damage from power surges.

4. Social Engineering:
- **Threat**: Manipulating individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security.
- **Protection**: Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees to recognize and resist social engineering attempts. Establish policies for handling sensitive information and verify identities before disclosing confidential information. Employ a principle of least privilege: don't provide any user with more access than they need to perform their job.
