- For two numbers `a and b` can we clearly state whether
	- `a >= b` is true or false
	- Without knowing  a or b
- There are solutions to this problem! (that are too complicated for this course!)

## Secure Multiparty Computation
- Also known as privacy preserving computation
- Allows multiple entities to compute a function over their inputs, while not sharing the inputs

## Design Issues
- Performing a SMP computation with differing values can leak information
- SMP has overheads, pre calculations and comparisons take time, with the matrix approaching having a time complexity of O(d^2), where d is the length of the largest of a and b as a binary string
- Homomorphic cryptography allows operations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption

##### Examples

1. 
```
Alice and Bob want to compare their wealth, but sadly they live in the 19th Century and dont have computers. They do have access to a well balanced scale that can compare the weight of two things and two large opaque boxes. Suggest a protocol that will allow them to compare their wealth without revealing their exact wealth to each other.
```

- Agree upon a collective thing to put inside their boxes - perhaps gold jewellery.
- Measure the weight of each box.
- The heavier box is more wealthy

It’s the present day and computers are back. When Alice and Bob started out, they weren’t quite millionaires, so the largest of their a and b values was $800,000. Twenty years down the track, the larger of the two values was $3,5000,000,000. What is the relative increase in computational load to carry out an SMP calcualation using the method of Ioannidis and Ananth?
