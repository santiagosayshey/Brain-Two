- CAP Theorem
	- We may have to settle for stale data to keep the system going
- EC says that we achieve high availability in distributed systems by allowing that at some point, every participant will agree upon the value of given data
- Referred to as BASE
	- Basically available
	- Soft State
	- Eventually consistent
- How?
	- Anti entropy - Exchanging versions between servers
	- Reconciliation - Choosing an appropriate final state
- This is a liveness issue, not a safety issue

##### Examples

```
Strong eventual consistency (SEC) adds the safety guarantee that two nodes which receive the same set of updates in any order will be the same state. How is this a safety guarantee?
