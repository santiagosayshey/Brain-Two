```
Transparent sharding automatically splits the database across a number of nodes. What is the problem that this introduces? And can you propose an algorithmic solution?
```

Transparent sharding introduces challenges such as data consistency, complex query operations, rebalancing shards, and choosing an effective shard key. An algorithmic solution like consistent hashing can help by distributing data evenly across shards and minimizing reorganization when nodes change, but it doesn't fully address transaction consistency or complexity in cross-shard queries.

```
Google Spanner is a NewSQL database that uses GPS based timestamps and version data. What will version data help to guarantee for data reads? Why do you think hardware base time is so important to spanner?
```

- When we version the data, we can say that x transaction should affect x version and vice versa and eliminate the need to cancel or queue transactions to ensure atomicity
