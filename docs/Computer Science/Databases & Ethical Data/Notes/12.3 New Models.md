```
Transparent sharding automatically splits the database across a number of nodes. What is the problem that this introduces? And can you propose an algorithmic solution?
```

Transparent sharding introduces challenges such as data consistency, complex query operations, rebalancing shards, and choosing an effective shard key. An algorithmic solution like consistent hashing can help by distributing data evenly across shards and minimizing reorganization when nodes change, but it doesn't fully address transaction consistency or complexity in cross-shard queries.
