## The HACK Computer
- 64KB of separate read only instruction memory
- 32KB + 16KB + 2B of separate read / write data memory
	- 32KB for RAM
	- 16KB for screen
	- 2B for I/O
	- Instructions are 1 word - 16 bits or 2 bytes
- The entire machine runs off a **single clock signal**
- All instructions take exactly the same amount of time to execute
- A lot of embedded systems may be structured like this

### Signal Propagation - What is the limitation of clock speed?
- The clock must not tick again until propagation completes
	- The output of every gate needs time to get to the next gate
	- Every gate needs time to respond to it's inputs
	- The longest path through the machine must be able to complete

- The longest path is *very* long
	1. The PC must send a new address to instruction memory
	2. Only then can a new instruction be used to change control signals
	3. Only then can the correct inputs reach the ALU
	4. Only then can the correct output leave the ALU
	5. Only then can a Jump be evaluated
	6. Only then is the new value of the PC known

- Until propagation completes, bad things appear to happen
	- Wrong data being read from memory
	- Wrong data being written to the wrong memory address
	- The wrong values flowing through multiplexers
	- The wrong address being written to PC
	- The wrong values being written to the A and D registers
- Why does the computer still work?
	- Because the wrong values are never saved!
	- Memory, PC, A and D not change until  the next clock tick
