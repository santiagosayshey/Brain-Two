## The HACK Computer
- 64KB of separate read only instruction memory
- 32KB + 16KB + 2B of separate read / write data memory
	- 32KB for RAM
	- 16KB for screen
	- 2B for I/O
	- Instructions are 1 word - 16 bits or 2 bytes
- The entire machine runs off a **single clock signal**
- All instructions take exactly the same amount of time to execute
- A lot of embedded systems may be structured like this
