## Values and Variables

- We store values (numbers, strings, Booleans, etc) inside variables
- We can then manipulate these variables with other variables or methods
- Variable names cannot start with a number

## Data Types

- JS is dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to manually define the type of variable you are assigning. It is done automatically
- Variables can change their type! They can be a number say, then be reassigned to be a string
	- Only use let keyword the first time you assign a variable, not needed when reassigning

```javascript
let a = true;
console.log(typeof a);

a = "SAM";
console.log(typeof a);
```

- We can use the `typeof` operator to return the type of a variable
```javascript
let a = true;
console.log(typeof a);
```

- Primitive type:
	- Number: always floating point, used for decimals and integers
	- String: sequence of characters, used for text, in quotes, single or double quotes
	- Boolean: true / false
	- Undefined: declaring a variable without a value. Both the variable and the value are undefined
	- Null: empty value, similar to undefined but used in different scenarios
	- Symbol: Unique and cannot be changed
	- BigInt: numbers too large for the number type

```javascript
let age = 23; // number
let firstName = "Jonas"; // string
let fullAge = true; // Boolean
let children; // undefined
```

## Let, Const and Var

- Use `let` to declare variables that can be changed later
- Use `const` to declare variables that cannot be changed later
	- Canâ€™t have undefined const variables
- Never use `var`, works like let in legacy JS

## Basic Operators

- Arithmetic operators
	- Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, powers, addition can be used to concatenate string
	- Power (2 ** 3 is 2 to the power 3)

- `typeof` operator
	- Returns the type of variable 

```javascript
Let a = true, typeof a boolean
```
- Assignment operators
	- Letting a variable equal a value

```javascript
X=10
X +=10 // is X=X+10, can be used with *=, -= and /= too
X++ // is X=X+1, X-- is X=X-1
```

- Comparison operators
	- Greater than / equal to, less than / equal to
	- `>`, `>=`,   `<`, `<=`
	- Entirely equal to
	- `===`

Let's format these notes for clarity and ease of reading:

## **Operator Precedence**

- JS will always compute mathematical operators before comparison operators.
- Operators can be processed from left to right or right to left.
	- Assignment occurs from right to left. This ensures mathematical and assignment operators are processed before the assignment takes place.
	- Enables dynamic typing; JavaScript determines the variable type because it reads right to left before assignment.
	- Assignment operator can be used multiple times in one line. Example: 

```javascript
X = Y = 10; 
// Y is assigned 10 first, then X is assigned the value of Y.
```
    
- Follows the BODMAS rule: Brackets, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.


## **Strings and Template Literals**

- Concatenating strings and variables can be cumbersome. 

```javascript
const sam = "I'm " + firstName + ", a " + (year - birthYear) + " year old " + job;
```

- Use template literals for easier string concatenation.

```javascript
const samNew = `I'm ${firstName}, a ${year - birthYear} year old ${job}`;
```

- Prefer backticks over quotation marks for strings; they are more versatile.
- Use `\n` for a new line or utilize actual new lines with backticks. Example:

```javascript
console.log(`yo
wassup
my
name
is
sam`);
```
