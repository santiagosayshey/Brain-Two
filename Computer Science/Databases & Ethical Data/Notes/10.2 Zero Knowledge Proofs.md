- A method by which one person can prove to another that something is true, without conveying any information except that statement is true

	- Completeness - It it’s true, an honest power will convince an honest verifier
	- Soundness - If it’s false, there is a very low probability of convincing people
	- Zero Knowledge - If it’s true, the verifier learns nothing more than the fact that’s true
