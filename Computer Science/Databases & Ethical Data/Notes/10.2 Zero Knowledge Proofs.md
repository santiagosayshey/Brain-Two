- A method by which one person can prove to another that something is true, without conveying any information except that statement is true
- Must satisfy:
	- Completeness - It it’s true, an honest power will convince an honest verifier
	- Soundness - If it’s false, there is a very low probability of convincing people
	- Zero Knowledge - If it’s true, the verifier learns nothing more than the fact that’s true

## Prove You Know Something
- Telling someone what you know is one way
- Giving secondary information is another, but it still leaks information
- How can you keep something secret and still prove that someone else knows it?

## Participants
- Prover
- Verifier

### Interactive Protocol
- The prover needs to convince the verifier that they have the knowledge
- The verifier needs to interact with the prover, and the prover responds to this interaction
- Because of this interaction, the verifier can’t just save the responses and use it to convince someone else
- A zero knowledge proof does not lead to other people gaining the knowledge

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Magic Cave Allegory

- **Concept**: Proving one possesses knowledge without revealing the actual knowledge.
- **Participants**:
  - **Peggy**: Prover, knows the magic word.
  - **Victor**: Verifier, wants proof but should not learn the magic word.
#### Cave Structure
- The cave has a **single entrance** and splits into two paths, rejoining at the other end.
- A **magic door** in the middle can only be opened with a special word.

#### Simplified Steps
1. **Peggy Enters the Cave**:
   - Peggy chooses either the left or right path.
   - Victor stays outside and cannot see which path she chooses.

2. **Victor’s Request**:
   - Victor shouts for Peggy to exit from either the left or the right path randomly.

3. **Peggy Exits the Cave**:
   - Peggy exits from the requested side, using the magic word if necessary.
   - Victor sees Peggy exit but doesn't know whether she used the magic word or retraced her steps.

4. **Repetition**:
   - The process is repeated multiple times.
   - Victor's confidence increases with every correct exit but he learns nothing about the magic word.

### Summary
- Peggy proves she knows the magic word without revealing it.
- Victor doesn't learn the magic word, regardless of repetition.
- This illustrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof, providing proof of knowledge without revealing any information about the knowledge itself.
