- A method by which one person can prove to another that something is true, without conveying any information except that statement is true
- Must satisfy:
	- Completeness - It it’s true, an honest power will convince an honest verifier
	- Soundness - If it’s false, there is a very low probability of convincing people
	- Zero Knowledge - If it’s true, the verifier learns nothing more than the fact that’s true

## Prove You Know Something
- Telling someone what you know is one way
- Giving secondary information is another, but it still leaks information
- How can you keep something secret and still prove that someone else knows it?

## Participants
- Prover
- Verifier

### Interactive Protocol
- The prover needs to convince the verifier that they have the knowledge
- The verifier needs to interact with the prover, and the prover responds to this interaction
- Because of this interaction, the verifier can’t just save the responses and use it to convince someone else
- A zero knowledge proof does not lead to other people gaining the knowledge

##### Example - The Magic Cave

![[Pasted image 20231002194053.png]]

	•	Cave Structure:
	•	The cave has a single entrance and is divided into two paths forming a circle, rejoining at the other end.
	•	There’s a magic door in the middle that can only be opened with a special word.
	•	Participants:
	•	Peggy knows the magic word and wants to prove this to Victor without revealing the word.
	•	Victor wants proof but should not learn the magic word.

Simplified Steps:

	1.	Peggy Enters the Cave:
	•	Peggy goes into the cave and stands at the magic door, choosing either the left or right path.
	•	Victor stays outside and cannot see which path she chooses.
	2.	Victor’s Request:
	•	Victor comes to the cave entrance and shouts to Peggy to exit the cave from either the left or the right path.
	•	He chooses the side randomly.
	3.	Peggy Exits the Cave:
	•	If Victor chooses the side Peggy initially went to, she simply retraces her steps.
	•	If Victor chooses the other side, Peggy uses the magic word to open the door and exit from the requested side.
	•	Victor sees Peggy coming out of the requested side but doesn’t know whether she used the magic word or simply retraced her steps.
	4.	Repetition:
	•	The process is repeated multiple times.
	•	With every correct exit, Victor’s confidence that Peggy knows the magic word increases, but he still doesn’t learn the word.

In Summary:

	•	Peggy proves she knows the magic word without revealing it.
	•	Victor remains in the dark about the actual word, no matter how many times the process is repeated.
	•	This process illustrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof because Peggy provides proof of knowledge (of the magic word) without conveying any information about the knowledge itself.
