- A method by which one person can prove to another that something is true, without conveying any information except that statement is true
- Must satisfy:
	- Completeness - It it’s true, an honest power will convince an honest verifier
	- Soundness - If it’s false, there is a very low probability of convincing people
	- Zero Knowledge - If it’s true, the verifier learns nothing more than the fact that’s true

## Prove You Know Something
- Telling someone what you know is one way
- Giving secondary information is another, but it still leaks information
- How can you keep something secret and still prove that someone else knows it?

## Participants
- Prover
- Verifier

### Interactive Protocol
- The prover needs to convince the verifier that they have the knowledge
- The verifier needs to interact with the prover, and the prover responds to this interaction
- Because of this interaction, the verifier can’t just save the responses and use it to convince someone else
- A zero knowledge proof does not lead to other people gaining the knowledge

##### Example - The Magic Cave
