## Binary Trees


![[Pasted image 20230821105539.png]]
- This is a binary tree
	- The root is the top node, A
	- Is a full binary tree because every node has 2 or 0 children
	- If we took the data out of it, there are at least four ways you could systematically extract those node values

### In Order Traversal
- An in order traversal examines the left branch, then the root, then the right giving us:
- If you look from left to right, its the node that comes directly most in th

```
D B E A F C G
```

### Pre Order Traversal
- A pre order traversal examines the root, then the left branch, then the right, giving us:

```
A B D E C F G
```
