## Binary Trees


![[Pasted image 20230821105539.png]]
- This is a binary tree
	- The root is the top node, A
	- Is a full binary tree because every node has 2 or 0 children
	- If we took the data out of it, there are at least four ways you could systematically extract those node values

### In Order Traversal
- An in order traversal examines the left branch, then the root, then the right giving us:

```
D B E A F C G
```

- If you look from left to right,  the node that comes directly most in the right direction is next
### Pre Order Traversal
- A pre order traversal examines the root, then the left branch, then the right, giving us:

```
A B D E C F G
```

- If you look from top to bottom, the node that comes directly to the bottom left comes next, and if there are none, go back to the first root where there was something on the right

### Post Order Traversal
- A post order traversal examines the left branch, then the right, then the root, giving usL

```
D E B F C G A
```

- If you look from bottom to top, the node that comes directly to the right is next, then the root of those nodes 

### Breadth First Traversal
- Also called level-first
- Examines the levels from left to right in turn:

```
A B C D E F G
```

- Looking from top to bottom, go from left to right on a single row, then down to the next row and left to right again, until the end

## Binary Search Tree
- Ordered so that the left branch holds smaller values and the right holds larger
- Average search is `O(logn)`

- They are no self balancing
- This is what happens if we enter data in a certain way!

- This isn't a tree, it's now a linked list and it's worst case search is `O(n)`

## B Tree
- This is a self balancing ordered tree, and can have more than 2 children per node

### Formal Definition
- A B Tree of order `m` is a tree that meets the following requirements:
	- Every node has at most `m` children
	- Every non leaf node (except the root) has at least m / 2, rounding up children.
	- The root has at least two children if it isn't a leaf node.
	- A non leaf node with `K` children contains `K-1` keys.
	- all leaves appear in the same level and carry
