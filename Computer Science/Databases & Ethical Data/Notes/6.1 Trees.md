## Binary Trees


![[Pasted image 20230821105539.png]]
- This is a binary tree
	- The root is the top node, A
	- Is a full binary tree because every node has 2 or 0 children
	- If we took the data out of it, there are at least four ways you could systematically extract those node values

### In Order Traversal
- An in order traversal examines the left branch, then the root, then the right giving us:

```
D B E A F C G
```

- If you look from left to right,  the node that comes directly most in the right direction is next
### Pre Order Traversal
- A pre order traversal examines the root, then the left branch, then the right, giving us:

```
A B D E C F G
```

- If you look from top to bottom, the node that comes directly to the bottom left comes next, and if there are none, go back to the first root where there was something on the right

### Post Order Traversal
- A post order traversal examines the left branch, then the right, then the root, giving us:

```
D E B F C G A
```

- If you look from bottom to top, the node that comes directly to the right is next, then the root of those nodes 

### Breadth First Traversal
- Also called level-first
- Examines the levels from left to right in turn:

```
A B C D E F G
```

- Looking from top to bottom, go from left to right on a single row, then down to the next row and left to right again, until the end

## Binary Search Tree
- Ordered so that the left branch holds smaller values and the right holds larger
- Average search is `O(logn)`

- They are no self balancing
- This is what happens if we enter data in a certain way!

- This isn't a tree, it's now a linked list and it's worst case search is `O(n)`

## B Tree
- This is a self balancing ordered tree, and can have more than 2 children per node

### Formal Definition
- A B Tree of order `m` is a tree that meets the following requirements:
	- Every node has at most `m` children
	- Every non leaf node (except the root) has at least m / 2, (rounding up) children.
	- The root has at least two children if it isn't a leaf node.
	- A non leaf node with `K` children contains `K-1` keys.
	- All leaves appear in the same level and carry no information.
- This is based on Knuth's definition of what a leaf meant. For us, The lowest level of nodes has no tree pointers, rather than tree pointers to null nodes.

### Advantages
- Handle deletions very efficiently.
- Reduce search base by factor of M rather than 2.
- Very useful for indexing large discs volumes.
- Keeps keeps. keys in order for sequential traversing
- Uses partially full blocks to speed up insertion and deletion.
- Balance. always balanced using a recursive algorithm
- Can be used as a primary file organisation for small files, but it's unusual

##### Examples

```
How could you traverse the B tree example shown to get the keys in the numerical order? IE name the traversal.
```

- In order traversal

```
We've talked about breadth first search, but what about depth first search? Is this one of the traversals shown? If so which one? Can you think of a good use for depth first search in a database context?
```

- Yes, it encapsulates In, Post and Pre order traversal. As we've mentioned, In order traversal can be used to get elements in order from a B tree, which are mostly used for databases
