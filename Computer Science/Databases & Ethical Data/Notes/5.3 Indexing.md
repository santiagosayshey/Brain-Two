- Auxiliary access structures that speed up retrieval in response to certain search conditions
- Typically provide secondary access paths
- Change the way we access records without changing physical placement
- Efficient access to records based on the indexing field
- Any attribute can be used to create an index
- Multiple indexes are common 

## Types of Indexes
- Single Live Indexes (Sequential Files)
- Multi level indexes (tree based structures)
- Hash-based indexes

### Primary Indexes
- Single level ordered index
	- Ordered file where records are fixed length with two attributes
	- First attribute is the same type as the ordering key attribute of the data
	- Second attribute is the pointer to a disk block (a block address)
	- If an index is dense:
		- We have an index entry for each search key value (hence every record)
	- If an index is sparse:
		- We have an entry for only some of the entries, not for each key
	- Primary keys are sparse and only have entries for each disk block


### Clustering Indexes
- We can order indexes on a non key field that does not have a distinct value for each record; this is called a **clustering field**
	- We can create clustering indexes to speed up retrieval for records that have the same value for the clustering field
	- Remember! Primary indexes need each value to be distinct!
	- A clustering index is an ordered field with two attributes (field)
		- First is of the same type as the clustering field
		- Second field is a block pointer
	- There is an index entry for each value of the clustering field
