- Auxiliary access structures that speed up retrieval in response to certain search conditions
- Typically provide secondary access paths
- Change the way we access records without changing physical placement
- Efficient access to records based on the indexing field
- Any attribute can be used to create an index
- Multiple indexes are common 

## Types of Indexes
- Single Live Indexes (Sequential Files)
- Multi level indexes (tree based structures)
- Hash-based indexes

### Primary Indexes
- Single level ordered index
	- Ordered file where records are fixed length with two attributes
	- First attribute is the same type as the ordering key attribute of the data
	- Second attribute is the pointer to a disk block (a block address)
	- If an index is dense:
		- We have an index entry for each search key value (hence every record)
	- If an index is sparse:
		- We have an entry for only some of the entries, not for each key
	- Primary keys are sparse and only have entries for each disk block

Imagine you have a bookshelf full of books. Each book has a unique number, let's call it a "Book ID".

Now, you also have a small notebook where you've listed all the Book IDs in order, and next to each ID, you've written the exact position of that book on the shelf.

This notebook is like a "Primary Index". It's a quick guide to find any book based solely on its unique Book ID.

### Clustering Indexes
- We can order indexes on a non key field that does not have a distinct value for each record; this is called a **clustering field**
	- We can create clustering indexes to speed up retrieval for records that have the same value for the clustering field
	- Remember! Primary indexes need each value to be distinct!
	- A clustering index is an ordered field with two attributes (field)
		- First is of the same type as the clustering field
		- Second field is a block pointer
	- There is an index entry for each value of the clustering field

Now, imagine you have a different bookshelf where books are grouped by their genre - like mystery, fantasy, or history. Within each genre, the books aren't in any specific order. So, if you're looking for mystery books, they are all together in one section, but they aren't ordered by their Book IDs.

You then have another notebook where you've listed all the genres, and next to each genre, you've noted down where those genre books start on the bookshelf. So if you're looking for a mystery book, you'd go to the "mystery" section in your notebook, see where that section starts on the bookshelf, and then search that section.

This notebook is like a "Clustering Index". It groups data (or books in our case) by a certain characteristic (genre) but doesn't detail every single item within that group.
