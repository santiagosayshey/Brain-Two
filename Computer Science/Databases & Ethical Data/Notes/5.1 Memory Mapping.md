## Memory
- A computer's storage media include:
	- Primary storage that can be directly acted upon by the CPU (Main memory and caches)
- Secondary storage that holds data which cannot be accessed by the CPU until it is transferred into primary storage
	- Discs, CDs and Tapes

### Primary Storage
- The different parts of primary storage have different performance characteristics
	- Main memory is the largest component of primary storage but is the relatively slowest to access
	- The caches provide increased access speed but at the cost of their size
		- There are often three, sometimes even four levels of cache
		- L1 caches can be very small and dedicated to specific tasks
		- L2 caches start go get larger and are more generic
		- L3 caches are larger

#### How Caching Works
- When the CPU wants to access data, it 
1. Checks the L1 cache first
	- If it finds what it's look for, that's a hit and execution proceeds, otherwise it's a miss
2. Then checks the L2 cache looking for a hit
3. Then L3
4. And if nothing hits, then it will access main memory over the databus

## Database Memory
- Databases are large!
	- The full database is often stored in secondary storage and only pieces of it are brought into main memory for operations
	- We have to design databases so that the storage, searching and indexing methods we use will be efficient based on how we know computers work
	- We need a way to manage volatility for integrity
