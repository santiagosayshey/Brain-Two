## Hashing
- A hash function transforms its input in the following way:
	- The data can be of any size but the hash value is of a fixed size
	- This means that the range of hash values may be (and often is) smaller than the range of values we hash
	- Hash values may not be unique
	- The same data will always generate the same hash value

```
Imagine you have a big box of crayons, and each crayon has a unique, fancy color name like "Sunset Orange" or "Deep Ocean Blue." Now, let's say you want a system to quickly find a crayon without having to read all those long names every time.

So, you decide to label each crayon with a simple number instead. This way, "Sunset Orange" might become "3", and "Deep Ocean Blue" might become "7". 

You do this using a special machine: you put a crayon into it, and it gives you a number. This machine is like our hash function.

Now, here are some things about this crayon-numbering system:

1. No matter how long the crayon's name is, the machine always gives you a small number (fixed size).
2. Sometimes, two different crayons might get the same number because there are so many crayons and only a few numbers to give. This is like when hash values are not unique.
3. Every time you put the same crayon (like "Sunset Orange") into the machine, it will always give you the same number ("3").
```

### Suitability
- Hashed based indexes are best for equality selections.
- They cannot do range searches.

```
A **hashed based index** has a "narrow" search range because it's optimized for pinpointing an exact piece of data. It's like asking, "Where is the book titled 'Moby Dick'?" and getting a direct location.

On the other hand, it's not designed for a "wide" search range where you might ask, "Can you show me all books written by authors whose last name starts with an 'H'?" For such broader, range-based queries, other types of indexes or search methods are more suitable.

## Static Hashing
- Build `n` buckets and use the modulus operation to group the range of the hash values to buckets containing data entries
- Collisions over time can lead to many overflow buckets - degrading performance
