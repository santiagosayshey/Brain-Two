## Hashing
- A hash function transforms its input in the following way:
	- The data can be of any size but the hash value is of a fixed size
	- This means that the range of hash values may be (and often is) smaller than the range of values we hash
	- Hash values may not be unique
	- The same data will always generate the same hash value
