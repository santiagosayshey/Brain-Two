- For two numbers `a and b` can we clearly state whether
	- `a >= b` is true or false
	- Without knowing  a or b
- There are solutions to this problem! (that are too complicated for this course!)

## Secure Multiparty Computation
- Also known as privacy preserving computation
- Allows multiple entities to compute a function over their inputs, while not sharing the inputs

## Design Issues
- Performing a SMP computation with differing values can leak information
- SMP has overheads, pre calculations and comparisons take time, with the matrix approaching having a time complexity of O(d^2), where d is the length of the largest of a and b as a binary string
- Homomorphic cryptography allows operations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption
