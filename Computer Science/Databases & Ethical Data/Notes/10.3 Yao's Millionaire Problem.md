- For two numbers `a and b` can we clearly state whether
	- `a >= b` is true or false
	- Without knowing  a or b
- There are solutions to this problem! (that are too complicated for this course!)

## Secure Multiparty Computation
- Also known as privacy preserving computation
- Allows multiple entities to compute a function over their inputs, while not sharing the inputs

## Design Issues
- Performing a SMP computation with differen
