- Database Design
1. Gather requirements
2. For the data requirements

## Conceptual Design
- This step constructs a conceptual schema:
	- A concise description of the data requirements of the users
	- Includes detailed descriptions of the entity types, relationships and constraints
	- Expressed using the concepts of the high level data model
- Importantly:
	- No implementation details
	- Easy to understand
	- Easy to communicate

## Entity - Relationship (ER) Model
- A high level conceptual model, it describes data as entities, relationships and attributes
### Entities
- The basic object in the ER is an entity, which represents some sort of thing in the real world that has an independent existence
- Could be a physical object
	- Car
	- House
	- Person
- Could be a concept
	- Business
	- Uni course

### Attributes
- Attributes describe the properties of entities
- Each entity will have some attributes to describe the detail of whatever it is that it's modelling
- Attributes occur in several different forms
	- Simple versus composite
	- Single valued versus multi valued
	- Stored versus derived

#### Simple v Composite
- Composite attributes can be divided into small parts
- Attributes that are not divisible are called simple or **atomic**
- Composite attributes can (and often do) form a hierarchy 

#### Single Valued v Multi Valued
- Single valued attributes have a single value for a particular entity
	- Age
- Multi valued attributes have a set of values for a particular entity
	- Colours of socks 

#### Stored v Derived
- A stored attribute is one that is explicitly defined in the entity
	- Year of birth
- A derivative attribute can be calculated or derived from another attribute
	- Your age is derivable from your year of birth

## Important Terminology
- Entity types define a collection of entities that have the same attributes
- The collection of all entities of an entity type at a given point is the entity set
- Entity types can have key attributes, unique to each entity in the set
- Each simple attribute is associated with a domain of values, a value set, that specifies the set of values that can be assigned to that attribute
