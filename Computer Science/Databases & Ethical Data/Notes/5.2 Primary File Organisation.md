- We would like to be able to store a single file inside only 1 block, so that we can keep it entirely within a cache

## Types of Files

### Heap Files
- Start with a file and just add records to the end of it
	- Often called "files of unordered records"
	- Very efficient to add new records
	- Inefficient to search (linear search)
	- Inefficient delete
		- Search
		- Load into memory
		- Delete record (possible leaving holes in the file)
	- Needs periodic reorganisation to reclaim lost space
	- May create sorted copies for particular operations

### Sorted Files
- Records are added to the file based on a field, the ordering field
	- Reading in ordering key order is very efficient
	- Key order adjacent records will be in the same block
		- We can use binary search to search over the sorted records
			- And we can even extend this to the blocks in which records are stor
