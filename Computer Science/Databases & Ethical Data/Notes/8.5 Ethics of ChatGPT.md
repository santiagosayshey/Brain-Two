## Large Language Models

> *A large language model or LLM is a deep learning algorithm that can recognise summarise, translate, predict and generate text and other forms of content based on knowledge gained from massive data sets. Large language models are amongst the most successful applications of transformer models*

### Transformers
- Tokenise data
- Run mathematical and statistical formula across the data to discover relationships
- Look for patterns
- Use the self attention mechanism that allows it to associate context with the tokens
- **Internet trained models have internet scale biases**

### Where does this data come from?
- Internet data sources
- "Conversations"
- Human feedback
