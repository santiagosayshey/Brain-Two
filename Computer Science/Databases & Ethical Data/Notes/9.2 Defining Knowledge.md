## What is Knowledge?
- Justified true belief (JTB)
	- Truth is the state of agreeing with the facts or reality
	- Belief is something that a person holds to be true
	- Justification is the reason that someone holds a belief
- Is this enough?

##### Example - A Cow
- I observe a shape on the hill
- I believe it to be a cow because it is cow shaped and dark
- The shape is a cow - WRONG
	- The hill is covered in cow shaped, dark objects that are not cows but rocks
	- The shape `I happened to look at` is a cow
	- This is the Gettier Problem - while the belief is true and justified, it is only true by accidenct

> *Cogito ergo moo?*
> I think therefore I moo
> I moo therefore I am cow

## Responses to Gettier Cases
- No false premises

```
Suppose a person looks at a broken clock and believes it is a certain time because the clock shows that time. The belief may be true and justified (the clock could be right by coincidence), but because it is based on a false premise (that the clock is working), this approach would say the person does not have knowledge.

- Reliabilism

```
If a person has a true belief about the weather because they consistently and accurately interpret meteorological data, reliabilism would say this counts as knowledge because the method (interpreting meteorological data) is reliable.
