## What is Knowledge?
- Justified true belief (JTB)
	- Truth is the state of agreeing with the facts or reality
	- Belief is something that a person holds to be true
	- Justification is the reason that someone holds a belief
- Is this enough?

##### Example - A Cow
- I observe a shape on the hill
- I believe it to be a cow because it is cow shaped and dark
- The shape is a cow - WRONG
	- The hill is covered in cow shaped, dark objects that are not cows but rocks
	- The shape `I happened to look at` is a cow
	- This is the Gettier Problem - while the belief is true and justified, it is only true by accidenct

> *Cogito ergo moo?*
> I think therefore I moo
> I moo therefore I am cow
