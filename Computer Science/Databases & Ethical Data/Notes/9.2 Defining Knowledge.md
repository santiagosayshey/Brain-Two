## What is Knowledge?
- Justified true belief (JTB)
	- Truth is the state of agreeing with the facts or reality
	- Belief is something that a person holds to be true
	- Justification is the reason that someone holds a belief
- Is this enough?

##### Example - A Cow
- I observe a shape on the hill
- I believe it to be a cow because it is cow shaped and dark
- The shape is a cow - WRONG
	- The hill is covered in cow shaped, dark objects that are not cows but rocks
	- The shape `I happened to look at` is a cow
	- This is the Gettier Problem - while the belief is true and justified, it is only true by accident

> *Cogito ergo moo?*
> I think therefore I moo
> I moo therefore I am cow

## Responses to Gettier Cases
- No false premises

```
Suppose a person looks at a broken clock and believes it is a certain time because the clock shows that time. The belief may be true and justified (the clock could be right by coincidence), but because it is based on a false premise (that the clock is working), this approach would say the person does not have knowledge.
```

- Reliabilism

```
If a person has a true belief about the weather because they consistently and accurately interpret meteorological data, reliabilism would say this counts as knowledge because the method (interpreting meteorological data) is reliable.
```

- Indefeasibility Condition

```
Suppose someone believes there is a sheep in the field based on seeing a white, fluffy object in the distance, and it turns out there is indeed a sheep behind a tree in the field. The personâ€™s belief is true and justified, but because they would have withdrawn their justification had they known the white, fluffy object was a dog, the indefeasibility condition would say they do not have knowledge.

## Philosophy of Science
- Science is a formalised form of the acquisition of empirical knowledge
- In this context, empirical knowledge is that gathered by experiment and observation, rather than the less formal "experience"

## Knowledge Sharing in Science
- We share discoveries in science as widely as possible to:
	- Provide a foundation for further science
	- To allow for confirmation
	- To allow for refutation
	- To build a chain of provenance that allows discoveries to be traced back to their foundations

## Attribution
- Scientific discoveries are attributed to the scientists or groups who are recorded as discovering them
- This is not always the person who discovered them
- This can have a bias towards the dominant group in society
- Some knowledge is kept secret because of its value
- What determines value?

##### Examples

1. 
```
You're working in a materials lab and discover a way to produce clean water with a cheap and simple graphene philtre. Will you publish this and what is your reasoning?
```

- Absolutely I will publish this. It could potentially improve the quality of life for many people. Some might refute this knowledge and claim that it worsens the quality of the water and save lives. Some might take this knowledge and improve upon it, making it even more cheap and simple.
