- Occurs when a secure or closed system reveals information to people not authorised to receive it
- Participants
	- Closed System - the thing you are keeping from everybody
	- Threat Vectors - loopholes through which people can access the closed system
	- Eavesdropper - someone who wants the leaked information

## Threat Vectors
- Anything that can leak sensitive information passively
	- Attribute names
	- Error messages
	- Data retrieval times
	- Network Traffic
	- Code comments
- Anything that can be actively targeted
	- Network
	- Users
	- Applications
	- Hardware

## Impact of Leakage
- Information theory tells us that the surprise value of data increases the information we gain
	- Every piece of data that can be observed from our system leaks information
	- If you leak the first letter of a suburb name, an X indicates it can only be one possibility, a `Z 1 1`
	- Everything in an error message or page can provide information
	- The more bits you leak, the more information an eavesdropper has **and can then derive**
	- Even the fact of a message can give things away

## Impact on System Design
- Access control
- Encryption of Data
- Scrubbing error messages
- Careful choice of keys
- Defining the attack surface
- Countermeasures
