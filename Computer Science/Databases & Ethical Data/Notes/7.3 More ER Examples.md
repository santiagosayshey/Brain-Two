## Modelling Dependants
- Employees might have children
	- Why do we need to keep track of them?
	- How do we keep track of them?
	- What does this look like in ER?

## ER Diagram for Dependants
- Dependants are a weak entity, they don't have (or need) their own key attribute (Entities with a key attribute are strong entities)
- A weak entity is identified by being associated with entities from another entity type, using one of that entity type's attributes
- This other entity type is the identifying or owner entity type
- The relationships type that relates a weak entity to its owner is an identifying relationship
- Weak entities always have a total participation constraint with respect to the identifying relationship because it cannot be identified without a relationship to the owner

- ER Modelling is iterative
	- Concepts may start as attributes and become relationships
	- Attributes in several entity types may be elevated or promoted to a new entity
	- Inversely, entities with only
