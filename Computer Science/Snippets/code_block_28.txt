##### Pass By Copy
- Pass by copy is the default behavior in C. When the function scope ends, the variables within it are discarded from memory.

##### Pass By Pointer
- Pass by pointer is an alternative to pass by copy, where a function takes pointers as arguments. Changes made to dereferenced pointer arguments affect the original variables.


### Static Variables
-   Static variables keep their value across multiple function calls and are only initialized once.
