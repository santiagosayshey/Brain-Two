### File Descriptors and Exec Group of Functions
-   A child process is created using `fork()`.
-   In the child process, the stdout is closed and a new file is created using `create()`.
-   The `execlp()` function is then used to run the `ls` command. Since stdout has been closed and replaced by the new file, the output of the `ls` command goes to the new file.
-   In the parent process, it waits for the child process to finish.
