## Pipes & Redirection

### Pipes in Bash

-   The `|` symbol allows for function chaining. E.g., `ls | wc -l` counts the number of lines outputted by `ls`.

### Pipes in C

-   Pipes in C use buffers to hold data between program executions.
-   Two file descriptors are needed for read/write operations, stored in a two-element array.
-   Read/write operations in C pipe communication are handled until the buffer is empty/full.

#### Implementation in C

-   In C, a writer process writes until the buffer is full and a reader process reads until the buffer is empty.
-   Both reader and writer consider standard input/output to be the file descriptors provided by the pipe array.
-   A pseudo pipe in C can replicate `ls | wc` from Bash, requiring careful use of `fork()` and `pipe()` system calls.
