### Function Calling

#### The Stack
-   During function calls, local variables are stored in a 'stack frame' within the 'stack'.

#### Persistence
-   Upon returning to the parent function, specific variables persist. Ways to retain others: file I/O, return value, altering pointers/references, static variables, dynamic memory.

#### The Heap
-   Dynamic memory allocation allows variables to exist beyond their local scope. Beware of memory leaks, when allocated memory can't be freed because there are no pointers to it.
