### INodes
-   Unix filesystem is based on INodes, data structures storing file info. It's divided into Super Block (general info), INode Table (INode details), and Data (actual file data).
-   INodes and their corresponding data are linked via indirect blocks.

### Access Modifiers
-   Unix `stat` command shows access, modify, and change timestamps for a file.


## Processes
### Process
-   A process is a currently running thread of execution on an operating system.

### Program
-   A program is a series of instructions executed in a sequence to perform a specific task.

#### Program vs Process
-   When a program starts execution, it becomes a process.
-   Processes can pause, and multiple processes can execute the same program.

### Processes in Unix
-   Unix processes can be viewed using commands like `ps`, `ps -a`, and `top`.

#### Executing Programs in Unix
-   Programs can be executed like bash commands. Alternatively, the `system` command can be used to execute Unix commands within a C program.
