## C Basics

### C++ vs C
-   Both are different in terms of semantics and structure.
-   C++ is more than just 'C with objects'; it introduces classes, exceptions, templates, and more.

### Booleans
-   These are values that can be true or false.
-   In C, booleans are typically represented using `int` or a boolean library, with non-zero values interpreted as true.
-   Use when you need to evaluate or store a true/false condition.
