- Recursively break down a problem into sub problems of the same or related type, until these become simple to be solved directly
- The solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem

##### Examples
- Sorting data (quick and merge sort)
- Integer multiplication (school method, Karatsuba algorithm)
- Closest pair of points problem
