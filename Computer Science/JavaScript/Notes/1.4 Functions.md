## **Functions**
- **Definition**: Functions are reusable code segments that automate repetitive processes.
- **Function Parameters**: Variables passed into a function that can be modified or utilized within the function.
- **Function Call**: Invoke a function by its name followed by parentheses and any required input parameters.
- **Return**: A function can return data to be utilized elsewhere in the program. Post return, subsequent code within the function won't execute.

```javascript
function juicer(a, o) {
  console.log(a, o);
  const juice = `Juice with ${a} apples, and ${o} oranges`;
  return juice;
}

console.log(juicer(1, 2));
console.log(juicer(5, 6));
```
## **Function Declarations vs. Expressions**
- **Function Declaration**: A traditional way of defining functions.

```javascript
function ageCalc(bYear) {
  return 2022 - bYear;
}

console.log(`I was born in ${ageCalc(21)}`);
```

- **Function Expression**: Functions stored in variables. 

  ```javascript
  const ageCalc2 = function(bYear) {
      return 2022 - bYear;
  };

  console.log(`I was born in ${ageCalc2(21)}`);
  ```
  
- Both approaches achieve the same outcome but have different syntactical representations.

## **Arrow Functions**
- A concise way to write functions, especially beneficial for short one-liners.

  ```javascript
  const calcAge = (birthYear) => 2022 - birthYear;

  console.log(calcAge(21));

  const yearsUnitlRetirement = (birthYear, name) => {
      const age = 2022 - birthYear;
      return `${name} will retire in ${65 - age} years`;
  };

  console.log(yearsUnitlRetirement(2001, "Sam"));
  ```

  Note: If the function body spans multiple lines, curly braces and the return keyword are necessary.

## **Functions Calling Other Functions**
- One function can invoke another, utilizing its output.

  ```javascript
  function cut(fruit) {
      //...
  }

  function juicer(fruit1, fruit2) {
      const a = cut(fruit1);
      const b = cut(fruit2);
      //...
  }

  juicer("apple", "kiwi");
  ```

## **Function Example**
- Functions can be nested to utilize and process data in stages.

  ```javascript
  function calcAge(birthYear) {
      return 2022 - birthYear;
  }

  function retirement(age) {
      return 65 - age;
  }

  function yearsUnitlRetirement(birthYear, firstName) {
      return retirement(calcAge(birthYear)) > 0
          ? `${firstName} retires in ${retirement(calcAge(birthYear))} years`
          : `You're old`;
  }

  console.log(yearsUnitlRetirement(2001, "sam"));
  ```
