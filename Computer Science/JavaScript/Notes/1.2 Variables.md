## Values and Variables

- We store values (numbers, strings, Booleans, etc) inside variables
- We can then manipulate these variables with other variables or methods
- Variable names cannot start with a number

## Data Types

- JS is dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to manually define the type of variable you are assigning. It is done automatically
- Variables can change their type! They can be a number say, then be reassigned to be a string
  - Only use let keyword the first time you assign a variable, not needed when reassigning
```javascript
let a = true;
console.log(typeof a);

a = "SAM";
console.log(typeof a);
```
- We can use the `typeof` operator to return the type of a variable
```javascript
let a = true;
console.log(typeof a);
```
- Primitive type:
  - Number: always floating point, used for decimals and integers
  - String: sequence of characters, used for text, in quotes, single or double quotes
  - Boolean: true / false
  - Undefined: declaring a variable without a value. Both the variable and the value are undefined
  - Null: empty value, similar to undefined but used in different scenarios
  - Symbol: Unique and cannot be changed
  - BigInt: numbers too large for the number type
```javascript
let age = 23; // number
let firstName = "Jonas"; // string
let fullAge = true; // Boolean
let children; // undefined
```

## Let, Const and Var

- Use `let` to declare variables that can be changed later
- Use `const` to declare variables that cannot be changed later
  - Canâ€™t have undefined const variables
- Never use `var`, works like let in legacy JS

## Basic Operators

- Arithmetic operators
  - Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, powers, addition can be used to concatenate string
  - Power (2 ** 3 is 2 to the power 3)

- Typeof operator
  - Returns the type of variable 
```javascript
Let a = true, typeof a boolean
```
- Assignment operators
  - Letting a variable equal a value

```javascript
X=10
X +=10 // is X=X+10, can be used with *=, -= and /= too
X++ // is X=X+1, X-- is X=X-1
```
- Comparison operators
  - Greater than / equal to, less than / equal to
  - `>`, `>=`,   `<`, `<=`
  - Entirely equal to
  - `===`
