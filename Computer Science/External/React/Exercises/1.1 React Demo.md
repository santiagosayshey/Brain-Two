- Some key take aways:
	- We create ‘components’, which are defined as functions and contain client javascript to control html elements
	- We return the raw HTML with any embedded javascript inside {}
	- We use state to be able to render variables inside our HTML, which will then be updated whenever it’s paired state function is called (with the updated value as its parameter)
		- When we initialise the state of a variable, we call the `useState()` function with the initial value of whatever the variable is
	- We can connect to APIs to get data which can then be stored as state
		- We can see how this can be used to talk to database endpoints to grab and update data from a database
	- We can also use effects to call functions at when the component is first created
	- Best of all, we can combine these components and use them just as regular html elements inside OTHER COMPONENTS!
		- We can pass elements into these elements using props (just like passing parameters to a function)
