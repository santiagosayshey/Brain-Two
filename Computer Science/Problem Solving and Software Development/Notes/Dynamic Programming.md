- Solve a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub problems
- Solve each of those sub problems just once and store their solutions
- The next time the same sub problem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, simply look up the previous computed solution
- This saves computation time at the expense of storage space

##### Examples
- Minimum edit distance
- Shortest path problem (Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall algorithms)
