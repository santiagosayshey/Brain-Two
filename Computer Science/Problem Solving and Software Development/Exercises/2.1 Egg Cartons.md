the other type contains 8 eggs. John wants to buy exactly *n* eggs.
Return the minimal number of egg cartons he must buy. If it's impossible
to buy exactly *n* eggs, return -1.

## Logbook

### Initial Thoughts
- My initial thought is to brute force this problem and iterate for every possible combination.
- Use an initial loop to iterate among the total number of cartons - starting with 1 and the largest carton
	- Check if 1 carton is enough, if not, move on to the next type of carton
- If 1 of any type of carton is not enough, then we move to every combination of two cartons
