## Problem Statement

```
You are given a int[] marks containing the grades you have received so far in a class. Each grade is between 0 and 10, inclusive. 

Assuming that you will receive a 10 on all future assignments, determine the minimum number of future assignments that are needed for you to receive a final grade of 10. 

You will receive a final grade of 10 if your average grade is 9.5 or higher.

## Definition

```
Class:	AimToTen
Method:	need
Parameters:	int[]
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int need(vector<int> marks)
(be sure your method is public)
```

 
##### Examples

```
{9, 10, 10, 9}

Returns: 0

Your average is already 9.5, so no future assignments are needed.
```

```
{8, 9}

Returns: 4

In this case you need 4 more assignments. With each completed assignment, your average could increase to 9, 9.25, 9.4 and 9.5, respectively.
```

```
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

Returns: 950
```

```
{10, 10, 10, 10}

Returns: 0
```

### Solution

```cpp
int AimToTen::need(std::vector<int> marks)
{

    float sum = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < marks.size(); i++) {
        sum += marks[i];
    }

    float average = sum/marks.size();
    int numAssignments = 0;

    if (average > 9.5) {
        return numAssignments;
    }

    else {
    
        while (average < 9.5) {
            numAssignments++;
            sum += 10;
            average = sum/(marks.size() + numAssignments);
        }

        return numAssignments;
    }
}
```
