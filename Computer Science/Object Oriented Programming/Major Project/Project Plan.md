## Project Idea:

Turn Based Rogue-Like presented entirely using OOP and SFML. Rogue-Likes are video games based on the game ‘Rogue’, originally released in 1980 and are usually characterised by perma-death and randomly generated dungeons. Popular examples include Slay the Spire, The Binding of Isaac, Faster than Light and Hades. 

```
Rogue-like is a catch all term that spans a variety of games over the past 40 years and really can be anything. It’s an interface for video games! They all have the same ‘gameplay loop’ at heart but often evolve into something much more unique. This is what makes it the perfect candidate for a coding project.
