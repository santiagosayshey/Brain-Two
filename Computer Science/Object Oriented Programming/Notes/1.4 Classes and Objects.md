## Classes vs Objects

**Class** - User defined data type whose variables are objects  
**Objects** - Have variables and functions  
An object is a runtime instantiation of a class

### Encapsulation

Combining variables and functions into a single object which belongs to a class

### OOP Design 101

- Start from a description of requirements
- Identify nouns as objects and their data members
- Identify verbs as interactions between objects
- Identify hierarchy of objects
- Identify object responsibilities

### Example Use Case

Write a program to manage the students' record in a classroom. Each student has a unique ID, name, and grade. The program should be able to:
- Print all the students in the classroom
- Find the grade of a student based on their ID
- Update the grade of a student
- Write the student’s records to a file
- Read the records from a file

#### Steps

1. From the design, identify the classes
2. Define the classes in code
3. Give states and behaviours
4. Instantiate objects from classes
5. Give variables to states and behaviours
6. Invoke their behaviour

#### Classes

- Students
    - ID
    - Name
    - Grade
- Classroom

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    private:
        string name;
        int ID;
        double grade;

    public:
        Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
            name=s_name;
            ID=s_ID;
            grade=s_grade;
        }

        // behaviours
        // get
        string get_name() {return name;}
        int get_ID() {return ID;}
        double get_grade() {return grade;}
        // set
        void set_name(string new_name) {name = new_name;}
        void set_grade(double new_grade) {grade = new_grade;}
};

int main() {
    Student s1("Sam", 1799298, 100);
    s1.set_name("Dan");

    cout << s1.get_name() << endl;
    cout << s1.get_grade() << endl;
    cout << s1.get_ID() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### States

- Name
- ID
- Grade

#### Behaviours

- Set/Get states

#### Private Members

- All data/functions cannot be directly accessed in the program except within the definition of a member function

### Constructors

- Function of a class - has the same name as the class
- Called automatically when a class is declared
- Used to initialize objects
- A default constructor that does nothing is always automatically generated if you don't define one
- Multiple constructors can be declared (discussed later)

### Member Function Definitions

Declare functions in public behaviours and define them later (or in another file with headers and cpp files)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    private:
        string name;
        int ID;
        double grade;

    public:
        Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
            name=s_name;
            ID=s_ID;
            grade=s_grade;
        }

        // declaration
        bool is_pass();
};

// definition of function
bool Student::is_pass() {
    if (grade > 50) 
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
```

### Pointers to an Object

Define the pointer that contains the address of an object

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

#include "student.h"

int main() {
    Student s1("Sam", 1799298, 100);
    Student* p = &s1;
    cout << p->get_name() << endl;
    cout << s1.get_name() << endl;

    Student *p = new Student("sam", 123, 23.9);
    cout << p->get_name() << endl;

    // ... trimmed for brevity

    return 0;
}
```

### Arrays of Objects

We can define an array of objects similar to an array of built-in data types like int. We can create a new dynamic array of objects using ‘new’ operator

```cpp
Student a1[10]; // array of 10 students
Student* a2[10]; // a pointer to an uninitialized array
Student* a3 = new Student[10]; // pointer to an array of 10 students
```

### Destructors

- Member function of a class that is called automatically when an object of the class goes out of scope or a pointer to the object is deleted
- Used to eliminate dynamic variables that have been created by the object so that the memory occupied is returned
- Can perform other clean up tasks as well

### Example Use Case 2

(Repeat of the Example Use Case described earlier)

Write a program to manage the students' record in a classroom. Each student has a unique ID, name, and grade. The program should be able to print all the students in the classroom, find the grade of a student based on their ID, and update the grade of a student. The program should write the student’s records to a file and also read the records from a file.
