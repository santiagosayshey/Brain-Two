## Run Time System
- Controls:
	- How to start program execution
	- How to handle program termination
	- How to pass function arguments
	- How to allocate and free memory resources
- Realised via VM translator and its subsequent commands -`pop, push, add, etc`
	- Along with this, some sort of ‘wrapper’ that acts as a sort of ‘main’ function for everything to work together

## High Level Magic
- Allow writing programs in high level terms 

```
x=-b+sqrt(power(b,2)-4*a*c)
```

- Primitive operations like `+ and -` are built into the basic syntax, whereas `sqrt and power` are extensions of the language
- High level languages allow us to never have to worry about how things like this get executed and how we execute multiple things one after another
