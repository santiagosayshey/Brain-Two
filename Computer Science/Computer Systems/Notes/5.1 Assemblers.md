## Background
- Machine languages can be binary or symbolic
- Writing binary machine code is borderline impossible (or at least wildly inefficient)
- This is why we write machine code symbolically and use an assembler to convert it to binary
	- And later, a compiler to convert high level languages into assembly code

## Translating Assembly to Binary 
- Input a stream of assembly instructions and generate an output of binary instructions
- Output is loaded into computer memory and
