## Background
- Machine languages can be binary or symbolic
- Writing binary machine code is borderline impossible (or at least wildly inefficient)
- This is why we write machine code symbolically and use an assembler to convert it to binary
	- And later, a compiler to convert high level languages into assembly code

### Symbols
- Consider the symbolic instruction `goto 312`. We can replace this with `goto LOOP` by recoding `LOOP=312` and this makes our code much easier to read
- This is why we use assembly languages
	- **Labels:** Declare and use symbols that mark locations in the code `LOOP & END`
	- **Variables:** Declare and use symbolic variables `i & sum` 
	- **Predefined Symbols:** Refer to special addresses in memory using symbols `SCREEN & KBD`
