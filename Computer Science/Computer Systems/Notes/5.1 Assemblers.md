## Background
- Machine languages can be binary or symbolic
- Writing binary machine code is borderline impossible (or at least wildly inefficient)
- This is why we write machine code symbolically and use an assembler to convert it to binary
	- And later, a compiler to convert high level languages into assembly code

## Translating Assembly to Binary 
- Input a stream of assembly instructions and generate an output of binary instructions
- Output is loaded into computer memory and executed
- Assembler must handle instructions and symbols

### Handling Instructions
1. Parse instruction into fields
2. For each field, generate corresponding bit code
3. If instruction contains a symbolic reference, convert symbol into it's numeric value
4. Assemble resulting binary into a string of sixteen bits (1 word)
