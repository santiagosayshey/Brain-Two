## Fundamentals

### Stored Program Concept
- A fixed hardware platform capable of executing a fixed set of simple instructions which exist temporarily in memory
- This means the platform can behave differently each time it is loaded with a new program

### Von Neumann Architecture
- A CPU interacting with memory, recieving data from an inp
- Memory stores not only the manipulated data, but the instructions that tell the computer what to do
