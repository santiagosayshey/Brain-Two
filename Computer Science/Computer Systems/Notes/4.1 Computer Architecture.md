## Fundamentals

### Stored Program Concept
- A fixed hardware platform capable of executing a fixed set of simple instructions which exist temporarily in memory
- This means the platform can behave differently each time it is loaded with a new program

### Von Neumann Architecture
- A CPU interacting with memory, receiving data from an input and emitting to some output
- Memory stores not only the manipulated data, but the instructions that tell the computer what to do

### Memory
- Linear sequence of addressable, fixed size registers each having a unique address and a value
- Stores data and instructions as sequences of bits
#### Data Memory
- Abstractions such as variables, arrays and objects are are just binary values stored in registers
- To read a register, supply an address and probe the value of the address
- To write to a register, supply an address and store a new value in the register, overriding the previous value

#### Instruction Memory
- High level code must first be translated into machine code
