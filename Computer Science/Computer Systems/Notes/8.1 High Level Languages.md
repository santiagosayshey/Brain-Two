> The assembly and VM languages presented so far in this book are low- level, meaning that they are intended for controlling machines, not for developing applications. In this chapter we present a high-level language, called Jack, designed to enable programmers to write high-level programs. Jack is a simple object-based language. It has the basic features and flavor of mainstream languages like Java and C++, with a simpler syntax and no support for inheritance. Despite this simplicity, Jack is a general-purpose language that can be used to create numerous applications. In particular, it lends itself nicely to interactive games like Tetris, Snake, Pong, Space Invaders, and similar classics.
