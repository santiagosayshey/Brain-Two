- Jack - a high level object based programming language similar to C++ / Java

## Examples
### Hello World
- Execution starts with a `main.main` function
- This means we need at least one class `main` which contains one function `main`

```jack
class Main {
	function void main() {
		do Output.printString("Hello World");
		do Output.println();
		return;
	}
}
```

- Comes with a standard library `Jack OS` for various functions including output
