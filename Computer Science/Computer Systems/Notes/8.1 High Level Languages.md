- Jack - a high level object based programming language similar to C++ / Java

## Examples

> Show. Don't tell
### Hello World
- Execution starts with a `main.main` function
- This means we need at least one class `main` which contains one function `main`

```jack
class Main {
	function void main() {
		do Output.printString("Hello World");
		do Output.println();      // new line
		return;                   // mandatory return statement
	}
}
```

- Comes with a standard library `Jack OS` for various functions including output

### Procedural Programming and Arrays

```jack
class Main {
	function void main() {
		var Array a;    // arrays are not typed
		var int length;
		var int i, sum
		let i = 0;
		let sum = 0;
		let length = Keyboard.readInt("How many numbers? ");
		let a = Array.new(length);

		while (i < length) {
			let a[i] - Keyboard.readInt("Enter a number: ");
			let sum = sum + a[i];
			let i = i + 1;	
		}

		do Output.printString("The average is: ");
		do Output.printInt(sum / length);
		do Output.printLn();
		return
	}
}
```

- Arrays come standard from the `Array` class

### Abstract Data Types
- Jack has three primitive data types - `int, char, boolean`
- We create new data types by instantiating classes that combine primitive data types
	- Suppose we want to handle rational numbers. We can create a new class which holds two integers `x, y` to represent the fraction `x / y`

- `fields` specify object properties (also called `member` variables)
- `constructors` are subroutines that creates a new object
- `methods` are subroutines that operate on the current object
- `functions` are class level subroutines that operate on no particular object
	- The difference between the two is merely semantic

### Linked List Implementation

### Operating System
- Currently, use OS classes abstractly

## Language Specification

### Syntactic Elements
- Jack programs are a sequence of tokens separated by whitespace
- Tokens can be symbols, reserved words, constants and identifiers

### Program Structure
- Programs are a collection of classes stored in the same folder
- One class must be `Main` and this class must have a function `main`
- Execution starts with the `Main.main` function
- Basic programming unit is a `class`
	- Each class exists in a separate class file `Class.jack`
	- Classes start with an uppercase letter
