> *When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.* - R. Buckminster Fuller (1895â€“1993)


## Code Generation
- The goal is to convert high level language understood by humans, into low level code understood by computers

### Handling Variables
- All primitive types are 16 bit, so each variable is 1 *word* long
- Static variables should exist only once during the entirety of the program's life
- Field variables should exist for each object and only during that object's life cycle
- Subroutine variables should exist for each time the routine is called and then freed after it ends
	- All of these are handled with the VM memory segments - `static, local, argument, this, that`
- Managed using a symbol table

#### Symbol Table
- When the compiler encounters a variable in a high level statement, it needs to know what memory segment it should belong to and what it represents

```
let y = foo(x)

- static, field, local?
- int, boolean, char, object?
```

- These properties can easily be managed using a **symbol table**
