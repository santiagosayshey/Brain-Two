- The ultimate goal is to be able to write high level code in Jack, use a compiler to compile it into bytecode, which is then translated into assembly code and then finally assembled into machine code, to be executed by the hardware.
- This two tier compilation model allows for cross platform compatibility, because we run the bytecode on a virtual machine which can then be translated according to the machine it's running on

## The Virtual Machine Paradigm
- High level code must be translated into machine code before it can run
	- We break this down into two stages
	1. High level code is parsed and translated into intermediate steps
	2. The intermediate steps are translated further into low level machine code of the target hardware
	- This allows us to keep a single high level compiler for a language, and implement virtual machines for different hardware sets to translate intermediate code
- This first program, called the compiler, translates high level code into intermediate VM commands
- The second program, called the VM translator, translates the VM commands further into the machine instructions of the target hardware platform 

![[figure_7.1.png]]

- The benefit with this model, is it allows developers to write code once, and execute it anywhere, even on new devices that don't exist yet
- The cost with this is reduced efficiency - verbose machine code as a result of multiple compilations

## Stack Machine
- Effective VM languages strike a balance between high and low level syntax
	- Should have reasonable expressive power - arithmetic logical commands, push / pop commands, function commands
	- Commands should also be low such that the machine code is tight and efficient
- To achieve this conflicting result, we use a *stack machine*

### Push / Pop
- Centrepiece of the stack machine is the *[[Computer Science/Algorithms and Data Structures/Notes/8.1 Stacks|Stack]]*â€¦ duh
	- A sequential storage space that grows and shrinks as needed
	- Supports two commands - `push, pop`
- Push:
	- Adds a value to the top of the stack (like adding a plate to a stack of plates)
- Pop:
	- Removes the stack's top value; the value that was just before it becomes the top of the stack
- We can say that stacks are *Last In, First Out*
	- The popped value is always the last one that was pushed into the stack

![[figure_7.2.png]]

- We can see that memory access is different in RAM vs the Stack
	- The stack is only accessible from the top, whereas any RAM address can be accessed from anywhere
	- Reading a value from the stack is lossy - Only the top value can be read, and only by popping it (though some stacks do allow you to read without removal, called `peek`). Reading from RAM has no affect on the state of memory
	- Writing to the stack entails adding a value to the top without updating other values, whereas writing in RAM is lossy by overriding a location's previous state

### Stack Arithmetic
- Consider the operation `x op y`, where `op` is just some operator applied to x and y - `add, subtract, etc`
- In a stack machine, these operations are carried out as follows:
	- Operands `x and y` are popped off the stack
	- `x op y` is computed
	- Result of operation is pushed onto the stack
	- Same can be done with unary operations `op x` for single values

##### Example - Addition and Negation on the Stack

![[figure_wo_caption_7.1.png]]

```
push 3
push 7
add
neg
pop x
```

##### Advanced Examples

- Looking at these, we can see that any high level complicated expression can be reduced down into a single value using a stack machine

### Virtual Memory Segments
- Don't use symbolic variables like `x, y, sum, etc` but variables are represented as entries in VM segments that have names like `static, this, local, etc`
	- First, second third static variables become `static 0, static 1, etc`
	- Something like `let x=y` becomes `push this 3, pop local 1`

- *Rest of segments covered later*
## Virtual Machine Specification
- Stack based, operations take their operands from, and store their results on the stack
- 1 data type - 16 bit signed integer
- A VM program is a sequence of commands:
	- `push / pop`
		- Transfer data between the stack and memory segments
	- `Arithmetic-Logical`
		- Perform arithmetic and logical operations
	- `Branching` 
		- Facilitate conditional and unconditional branching operations
	- `Function`
		- Facilitate function call and return operations

### Push / Pop Commands

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822131537.png)

### Arithmetic-Logical Commands
- Arithmetic commands: `add`, `sub`, `neg`
- Comparison commands: `eq`, `gt`, `lt`
- Logical commands: `and`, `or`, `not`
- All require two operands
	- Pop two values off the stack, computes the stated function with values, pushes result back onto the stack

## Implementation
- Use a VM translator to convert VM commands into machine language
	- Using a stack and virtual memory segments
	- Translate each VM command into a sequence of low level instructions
- Von Neumann example
	- Represent VM stack using a designated memory block in the host RAM
	- Lower end of the block will be a fixed base address
	- Higher end will change as the stack grows and shrinks
	- We can manage the stack by keeping track of a stack pointer, which holds the address of the RAM entry after the top most value of the stack
		- This value will initially be `stackBase` which is the bottom of the stack
	- `push x` can be implemented via `RAM[SP] = x`, followed by `SP++` to increment the stack pointer
	- `pop x` can be implemented via `SP--`, followed by `x = RAM[SP]`
- Hack Example
	- Set stack base at address 256 in Hack RAM
		- `SP=256` via `@256, D=A. @SP, M=D`
	- The VM translator can then handle each push and pop command by generating assembly that realises `RAM[SP++] = x` or `x = RAM[SP--]`

### VM Mapping on the Hack Platform
- VM Program is a sequence of commands stored in a text file named `FileName.vm` 
	- First letter must be uppercase
	- Each line is a separate VM command, to be translated into one or more instructions in assembly code
- VM abstraction has only data type - two's complement 16 bit value - i.e. A signed integer
	- VM Boolean true / false are represented as `-1 and 0` respectively
- Hack RAM consists of 32K 16bit words

- Recall our predefined symbols used in assemblers:

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822135445.png)

- For now, assume these have been already initialised to suitable addresses in RAM
- Their addresses aren't important to the VM anyway
- Suppose we want to storage the D register on the stack: `RAM[SP++] = D`
	- This can be realised in assembly using: `@SP, A=M, M=D, M=M+1`

- `@SP`: This is loading the address of the `SP` register.
- `A=M`: Once the address in `SP` has been loaded, this sets the `A` register to whatever value is in memory at the address held in `SP`. Essentially, `A` now holds the address of the top of the stack.
- `M=D`: This assigns the value in the `D` register to the RAM location pointed to by the `A` register. Given the previous step, this effectively stores the value in `D` at the top of the stack.
- `M=M+1`: This increments the value at the RAM location pointed to by the `A` register.

#### Mapping Memory Segments
- Base address of segments `local, argument, this, that` are stored in registers `LCL, ARG, THIS, THAT` respectively
	- Any access to the `nth` value of a virtual segment `push / pop segmentName n` is translated into assembly that accesses address `base+n`, where `base` is a pointer to `LCL, ARG, THIS, or THAT`
- Pointer segment contains two values, mapped to registers 3 and 4 `THIS and THAT`
	- Access to `pointer 0 or 1` is done by accessing the `THIS or THAT` pointer
	- `pop pointer 0` sets `THIS` to the popped value
	- `push pointer 1` should push onto the stack the current value of `THAT`
- Temp - 8 word segment mapped to registers 5-12
	- Any access to `temp i` where `i` varies from 0 - 7 is translated into assembly code that accesses RAM at locations `5 + i`
- Constant - doesn't occupy any ram space, just supplies the constant `i`
	- `push constant 17` will translate in assembly to pushing the value of 17 onto the stack
- Static - mapped to addresses 16-255 (maximum of 240 static variables)
	- Each reference to `static i` are the variables created in VM code
	- `push constant 100, push constant 200, pop static 5, pop static 2` causes `static 5 and static 2` to be mapped on RAM addresses 16 and 17 respectively
- Stack begins at address 256

### VM Emulator
- A simple to way to implement a VM is to write a high level program representing a stack + memory segments and implement the BM commands using high level programming
- Stack can be represented using a large array and push, pop can be realised literally using high level statements like `RAM[SP++] = D`
- Combined with a GUI, this can be a good way to visualise how the stack works

### Implementing a VM
- Uses three modules
	1. Parser - Make sense out of each VM command - understand what the command seeks to do
	2. CodeWriter - translate the understood VM command into assembly instruction
	3. Main program called `VMTranslator` - Drives the translation process

- Translator accepts a single command line argument

```shell
$ > VMTranslator source
```

- Where `source` is a file name of form `ProgName.vm`

#### Parser
- Handles the parsing of a single `.vm` file
- Provides services for reading a VM command, unpacking the command into various components, providing convenient access to components
- Ignores all white space and comments

![](Images/figure_wo_caption_7.4.png)

##### Example
- If the current command is `push local 2`, then calling `arg1() and arg2()` would return, respectively `local` and `2`
- If the current command is `add`, then calling `arg1() and arg2()`  would return `add` and `arg2()` would not be called

#### CodeWriter
- Translates a parsed VM command into assembly

![](Images/figure_wo_caption_7.5.png)

##### Example
- Calling `writePushPop (C_PUSH, "local", 2` would result in generating assembly instructions that implement the VM command `push local 2`
- Calling `writeArithmetic("add")`
