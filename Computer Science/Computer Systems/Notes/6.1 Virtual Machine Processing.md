- The ultimate goal is to be able to write high level code in Jack, use a compiler to compile it into bytecode, which is then translated into assembly code and then finally assembled into machine code, to be executed by the hardware.
- This two tier compilation model allows for cross platform compatibility, because we run the bytecode on a virtual machine which can then be translated according to the machine it's running on

## The Virtual Machine Paradigm
- High level code must be translated into machine code before it can run
	- We break this down into two stages
	1. High level code is parsed and translated into intermediate steps
	2. The intermediate steps are translated further into low level machine code of the target hardware
	- This allows us to keep a single high level compiler for a language, and implement virtual machines for different hardware sets to translate intermediate code
- This first program, called the compiler, translates high level code into intermediate VM commands
- The second program, called the VM translator, translates the VM commands further into the machine instructions of the target hardware platform

- The benefit with this model, is it allows developers to write code once, and execute it anywhere, even on new devices that don't exist yet
- The cost with this is reduced efficiency - verbose machine code as a result of multiple compilations

## Stack Machine
- Effective VM languages strike a balance between high and low level syntax
	- Should have reasonable expressive power - arithmetic logical commands, push / pop commands, function commands
	- Commands should also be low such that the machine code is tight and efficient
- To achieve this conflicting result, we use a *stack machine*

### Push / Pop
- Centrepiece of the stack machine is the *[[Computer Science/Algorithms and Data Structures/Notes/8.1 Stacks|Stack]]*â€¦ duh
	- A sequential storage space that grows and shrinks as needed
	- Supports two commands - `push, pop`
- Push:
	- Adds a value to the top of the stack (like adding a plate to a stack of plates)
- Pop:
	- Removes the stack's top value; the value that was just before it becomes the top of the stack
- We can say that stacks are *Last In, First Out*
	- The popped value is always the last one that was pushed into the stack

- We can see that memory access is different in RAM vs the Stack
	- The stack is only accessible from the top, whereas any RAM address can be accessed from anywhere
	- Reading a value from the stack is lossy - Only the top value can be read, and only by popping it (though some stacks do allow you to read without removal, called `peek`). Reading from RAM has not affect on the state of memory
	- Writing to the stack entails adding a value to the top without updating other values, whereas writing in RAM is lossy by overriding a location's previous state

### Stack Arithmetic
- Consider the operation `x op y`, where `op` is just some operator applied to x and y - `add, subtract, etc`
- In a stack machine, these operations are carried out as follows:
	- Operands `x and y` are popped off the stack
	- `x op y` is computed
	- Result of operation is pushed onto the stack
	- Same can be done with unary operations `op x` for single values

##### Example - Addition and Negation on the Stack

```
- pop 3, 7
- 3 + 7 = 10
- push 10
- pop 10
- -1 * 10 = -10
- push -10
```
