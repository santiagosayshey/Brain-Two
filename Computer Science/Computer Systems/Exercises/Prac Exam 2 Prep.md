Category: **VM Expressions (a+(b-c))**

Select 5 lines of Hack VM Language, in the order they must be executed, that will implement the Jack expression:

`(a+(b-c))`

Notes:
- The expression must be evaluated left to right.
- The variables a, b, and c are in the local segment at offsets 7, 8, and 9.

**Question 9** 1 pts

Category: **Assembler Symbol Tables**

Consider the following Hack assembly code:

```assembly
@R1
D=M
@START
D;JGE
@y
M=D
@z
M=D
(RETURN)
D=D-A
@RETURN
D;JEQ
(START)
@START
0;JMP
```

Fill in the appropriate symbol table entries below as they would be after the assembler's first pass.

Your answer should be a positive integer or -
Answer - for predefined symbols or other symbols that should not be present in the symbol table following the first pass.

R1 	
D 	
M 	
START 	
JGE 	
y 	
z 	
RETURN 	
A 	
JEQ 	
JMP

**Question 10** 1 pts

Category: **CPU Wiring**

Look at the provided (incomplete) diagram of the Hack CPU. Consider the wire pointed to by the blue arrow.

Where does the signal on this wire come from and what action does this signal trigger?

Group of answer choices:

1. This is the "jump" wire coming from the instruction memory. This tells the ALU whether to jump to the next instruction or execute the current instruction.
2. This is the "output" wire that comes out of the ALU. This sends the result of the ALU to the memory.
3. This is the "read" wire connected to the RAM. This wire indicates whether the CPU should read or write to the RAM.
4. This is the "write" wire that comes out of the ALU. This signals the memory to store the output value of the ALU.
