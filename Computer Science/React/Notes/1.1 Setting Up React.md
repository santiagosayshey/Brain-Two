- In the terminal, we can write:

```bash
npx create-react-app@5 <app-name>
```

- And this will initialise a new folder of `app-name` with all the necessary packages, files, etc
- Later, we will use Vite instead of create-react-app

## Index.js

- Inside of our `src` folder, we need to have an `index.js` file which will be the main file of a react app
	- This name can be changed in the webpack settings

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello React!</h1>
        </div>
    )
}

const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

## CSS

- We can add external css to our components by importing at the top of the file

```js
import "./index.css"
```

- We use `className` instead of `class` to add classes to elements in JSX
