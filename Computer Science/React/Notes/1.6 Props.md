- Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree)
- Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
- With props, parent components control how child components look and work
- Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components

```jsx
function PersonCard(props) {
    return (
        <div className="person-card">
            <h3>{props.name}</h3>
            <p>{props.description}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <PersonCard name="Alice Wonderland" description="Loves adventures" />
            <PersonCard name="Bob Builder" description="Enjoys construction" />
            <PersonCard name="Charlie Chocolate" description="Chocolate factory owner" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

- Props are read only, they are **immutable**
- If you need to mutate props, you actually need to be using state

- Mutating props would affect parent, creating side effects
- Components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state
- This allows react to optimise apps, avoid bugs and make apps predictable

## One Way Data Flow
- Components should only be passed from parent to child
- Makes apps more predictable and easier to understand
- Makes apps easier to debug as we have more control over the data
- Is more performant
