- Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components (down the component tree)
- Essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
- With props, parent components control how child components look and work
- Anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, even other components

```jsx
function PersonCard(props) {
    return (
        <div className="person-card">
            <h3>{props.name}</h3>
            <p>{props.description}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

```jsx
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <PersonCard name="Alice Wonderland" description="Loves adventures" />
            <PersonCard name="Bob Builder" description="Enjoys construction" />
            <PersonCard name="Charlie Chocolate" description="Chocolate factory owner" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

- Props are read only, they are **immutable**
- If you need to mutate props, you actually need to be using state

![[Pasted image 20230814013750.png]]

- Mutating props would affect parent, creating side effects
- Components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state
- This allows react to optimise apps, avoid bugs and make apps predictable

## One Way Data Flow
- Components should only be passed from parent to child
- Makes apps more predictable and easier to understand
- Makes apps easier to debug as we have more control over the data
- Is more performant

## Rendering Lists

- We can loop over an array and render components with each element in an array:
- We also need to pass in another prop `key` 
	- This is for performance optimisation

```js
<div>
	{pizzaData.map(pizza => (
		<Pizza pizza={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
	))}
</div>
```

- This will loop over the array `pizzaData` using the `map` method
- It will then create a new element for each pizza, and pass the current `pizzaData` into the `pizza` component, to be rendered using props:

```js
function Pizza({ pizza }) {
    return (
        <div className="pizza">
            <img src={pizza.photoName} alt="pizza"></img>
            <div>
                <h3>{pizza.name} </h3>
                <p>
                    {pizza.ingredients}
                </p>
                <span>{pizza.price}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Conditional Rendering

### Short Circuit Rendering

- Can use short circuiting via `&&` to conditionally render JSX

```js
function Footer() {
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    const openHour = 12;
    const closeHour = 22;

    const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

    return <footer className="footer">
        {isOpen &&
            <div className="order">
                <p>We're open until {closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.</p>}
                <button className="btn">Order</button>
            </div>}
    </footer>
}
```

- The footer will only render if `isOpen` is true

### Ternary Rendering
- Better way is to use the ternary operator so that we can include an else statement

```js
function Footer() {
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    const openHour = 12;
    const closeHour = 22;

    const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

    return (
        <footer className="footer">
            <div className="order">
                {isOpen ? (
                    <>
                        <p>We're open until {closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.</p>
                        <button className="btn">Order</button>
                    </>
                ) : (
                    <p>We're currently closed. Please come back later!</p>
                )}
            </div>
        </footer>
    );
}
```

### Multiple Returns
- We can also conditionally render by adding multiple return statements inside a component
- This method is a bit easier to understand, but more boilerplate code 
	- Works really well when you break components down as small as they can be

```js
function Footer() {
    const hour = new Date().getHours();
    const openHour = 12;
    const closeHour = 22;

    const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

    if (!isOpen) {
        return (
            <footer className="footer">
                <div className="order">
                    <p>We're currently closed. Please come back later!</p>
                </div>
            </footer>
        )
    } else {
        return (
            <footer className="footer">
                <div className="order">
                    <p>We're open until {closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.</p>
                    <button className="btn">Order</button>
                </div>
            </footer>

        )
    }
}
```
