- React apps are made entirely out of components
- Building blocks of user interfaces in React
- Piece of UI that has it's own data, logic and and appearance (how it works and looks)
- We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them
- Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them

## Creating and Reusing a Component

- Component functions must be an uppercase letter
- Component must return some html (only one element, but can have nested inside that one element)
- We mount components inside other components as we do any other HTML element

```js
function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Pizza />
            <Pizza />
            <Pizza />
        </div>
    )
}

function Pizza() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Pizza Prosciutto</h1>
            <p>
                Tomato, mozarella, ham, aragula, and burrata cheese
            </p>
            <img src="pizzas/prosciutto.jpg" alt="pizza"></img>
        </div>
    )
}
```
## Fragments
- JSX Snippets and return statements can only return one root element at a time
- To get around this, we can wrap all of our elements inside a fragment `<> </>`
	- We technically can just wrap everything in a div, but often this ruins formatting if we haven't defined styling for that specific div

```js
function Menu() {
    const numPizzas = pizzaData.length;
    // const numPizzas = 0;

    return (
        <main className="menu">
            <h2>Our Menu</h2>
            {numPizzas > 0 ? (
                <>
                    <p>
                        Authentic Italian cuisine. 6 creative dishes to choose from. All from our stone oven, all organic, all delicious.
                    </p>
                    <ul className="pizzas">
                        {pizzaData.map(pizza => (
                            <Pizza pizza={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
                        ))}
                    </ul>
                </>
            ) : (
                <p>
                    We're still working on our menu. Please come back later!
                </p>
            )}
        </main>
    )
}
```
