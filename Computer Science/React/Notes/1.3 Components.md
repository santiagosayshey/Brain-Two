- Inside of our `src` folder, we need to have an `index.js` file which will be the main file of a react app
	- This name can be changed in the webpack settings

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello React!</h1>
            <p>WASSUP</p>
        </div>
    )
}

const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```
