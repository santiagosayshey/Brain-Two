## Rules
- Works like HTML, but we can enter "JavaScript mode" by using `{}` (for text or attributes)
- We can place JavaScript expressions inside `{}`
	- Examples include: reference variables, create arrays or objects, `[].map()`, ternary operators
- Statements are NOT allowed `if / else, for, switch`
- JSX produces a JavaScript expression
