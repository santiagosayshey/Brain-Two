## What is Death?
- Two types of death: Somatic and Cellular

### Somatic
- The complete and irreversible stoppage of the vital functions

### Cellular
- The cessation of respiration and metabolism of the body tissues

## When you Die
- Four main stages the body undergoes

1. Body cools
2. Blood settles
3. Body stiffens
4. Decomposition sets in

### Stage 1 - Body Cools
- Also known as `Algor Mortis`
	- The cooling of the body after death until it reaches ambient temperature
- Affected by:
	- Ambient temp
	- Body temp at the time of death
	- Wind
	- Moisture
	- Body weight
	- Clothing

### Stage 2 - Blood Settles
- Also known as `Livor Mortis`
	- The discolouration of the skin due to the pooling of blood in the dependant parts of the body following death due to gravity
- Different time periods
	- Non-fixed (2-8 hrs after death) - blood can still be moved
	- Fixed (8-24 hrs after death) - blood cannot be moved
