## What is Death?
- Two types of death: Somatic and Cellular

### Somatic
- The complete and irreversible stoppage of the vital functions

### Cellular
- The cessation of respiration and metabolism of the body tissues

## When you Die
- Four main stages the body undergoes

1. Body cools
2. Blood settles
3. Body stiffens
4. Decomposition sets in

### Stage 1 - Body Cools
- Also known as `Algor Mortis`
	- The cooling of the body after death until it reaches ambient temperature
- Affected by:
	- Ambient temp
	- Humidity
	- Body temp at the time of death
	- Infection
	- Drugs
	- Wounds
	- Wind
	- Moisture
	- Body weight
	- Clothing
	- Artificial cooling

### Stage 2 - Blood Settles
- Also known as `Livor Mortis`
	- The discolouration of the skin due to the pooling of blood in the dependant parts of the body following death due to gravity
- Different time periods
	- Non-fixed (2-8 hrs after death) - blood can still be moved
	- Fixed (8-24 hrs after death) - blood cannot be moved
- Not a reliable indicator of time since death
- Useful for determining the position of the body after death

- This image shows that during this stage, blood can still be moved

- This image shows blood pooling after death, vital in determining position of the body, clothing, etc

### Stage 3 - Body Stiffens
- Also known as `Rigor Mortis`
	- Stiffening of the limbs of a body caused by chemical changes in the muscles after death
- Develops 2-4 hours after death, and is usually fully developed after 6-12 hours
	- Influenced by heavy exercise, warm temp increases, cold decreases

### Stage 4 - Decomposition
- Process by which organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter
- Made up of two processes: Autolysis and Putrefaction

#### Autolysis
- Sterile breakdown of the tissues caused by enzymatic actions
- Temperature dependant (heat increases breakdown)
- Different for various organs

#### Putrefaction
- Disintegration of tissues due to bacterial and microorganism growth and activity
- Broken down into stages
	- Venous marbling / green discolouration 
	- Skin blisters
	- Skin slippage
	- Bloating
	- Purging
	- Black discolouration

- Example of purging

- Black discolouration 

### Other Post Mortem Phenomenon
- Adipocere
	- A waxy substance derived from body fat

- Mummifcation
	- The drying of a body that leads to preservation

- Post mortem predation
	- Consumption of flesh and deeper tissues of a body after death by animals

## Time of Death
- Bodies and the changes after death affected by many different factors
- Changes in conditions over time
- As time increases, accuracy of estimation decreases
